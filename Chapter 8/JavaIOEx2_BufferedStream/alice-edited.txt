Titl[]: Alic[]'s Adv[]ntur[]s in Wond[]rland

CHAPTER I.
Down th[] Rabbit-Hol[]
Alic[] was b[]ginning to g[]t v[]ry tir[]d of sitting by h[]r sist[]r on th[] bank, and of having nothing to do: onc[] or twic[] sh[] had p[][]p[]d into th[] book h[]r sist[]r was r[]ading, but it had no pictur[]s or conv[]rsations in it, "and what is th[] us[] of a book," thought Alic[] "without pictur[]s or conv[]rsations?"

So sh[] was consid[]ring in h[]r own mind (as w[]ll as sh[] could, for th[] hot day mad[] h[]r f[][]l v[]ry sl[][]py and stupid), wh[]th[]r th[] pl[]asur[] of making a daisy-chain would b[] worth th[] troubl[] of g[]tting up and picking th[] daisi[]s, wh[]n sudd[]nly a Whit[] Rabbit with pink []y[]s ran clos[] by h[]r.

Th[]r[] was nothing so v[]ry r[]markabl[] in that; nor did Alic[] think it so v[]ry much out of th[] way to h[]ar th[] Rabbit say to its[]lf, "Oh d[]ar! Oh d[]ar! I shall b[] lat[]!" (wh[]n sh[] thought it ov[]r aft[]rwards, it occurr[]d to h[]r that sh[] ought to hav[] wond[]r[]d at this, but at th[] tim[] it all s[][]m[]d quit[] natural); but wh[]n th[] Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pock[]t, and look[]d at it, and th[]n hurri[]d on, Alic[] start[]d to h[]r f[][]t, for it flash[]d across h[]r mind that sh[] had n[]v[]r b[]for[] s[][]n a rabbit with []ith[]r a waistcoat-pock[]t, or a watch to tak[] out of it, and burning with curiosity, sh[] ran across th[] fi[]ld aft[]r it, and fortunat[]ly was just in tim[] to s[][] it pop down a larg[] rabbit-hol[] und[]r th[] h[]dg[].

In anoth[]r mom[]nt down w[]nt Alic[] aft[]r it, n[]v[]r onc[] consid[]ring how in th[] world sh[] was to g[]t out again.

Th[] rabbit-hol[] w[]nt straight on lik[] a tunn[]l for som[] way, and th[]n dipp[]d sudd[]nly down, so sudd[]nly that Alic[] had not a mom[]nt to think about stopping h[]rs[]lf b[]for[] sh[] found h[]rs[]lf falling down a v[]ry d[][]p w[]ll.

Eith[]r th[] w[]ll was v[]ry d[][]p, or sh[] f[]ll v[]ry slowly, for sh[] had pl[]nty of tim[] as sh[] w[]nt down to look about h[]r and to wond[]r what was going to happ[]n n[]xt. First, sh[] tri[]d to look down and mak[] out what sh[] was coming to, but it was too dark to s[][] anything; th[]n sh[] look[]d at th[] sid[]s of th[] w[]ll, and notic[]d that th[]y w[]r[] fill[]d with cupboards and book-sh[]lv[]s; h[]r[] and th[]r[] sh[] saw maps and pictur[]s hung upon p[]gs. Sh[] took down a jar from on[] of th[] sh[]lv[]s as sh[] pass[]d; it was lab[]ll[]d "ORANGE MARMALADE", but to h[]r gr[]at disappointm[]nt it was []mpty: sh[] did not lik[] to drop th[] jar for f[]ar of killing som[]body und[]rn[]ath, so manag[]d to put it into on[] of th[] cupboards as sh[] f[]ll past it.

"W[]ll!" thought Alic[] to h[]rs[]lf, "aft[]r such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brav[] th[]y'll all think m[] at hom[]! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, []v[]n if I f[]ll off th[] top of th[] hous[]!" (Which was v[]ry lik[]ly tru[].)

Down, down, down. Would th[] fall n[]v[]r com[] to an []nd? "I wond[]r how many mil[]s I'v[] fall[]n by this tim[]?" sh[] said aloud. "I must b[] g[]tting som[]wh[]r[] n[]ar th[] c[]ntr[] of th[] []arth. L[]t m[] s[][]: that would b[] four thousand mil[]s down, I think -- " (for, you s[][], Alic[] had l[]arnt s[]v[]ral things of this sort in h[]r l[]ssons in th[] schoolroom, and though this was not a v[]ry good opportunity for showing off h[]r knowl[]dg[], as th[]r[] was no on[] to list[]n to h[]r, still it was good practic[] to say it ov[]r) " -- y[]s, that's about th[] right distanc[] -- but th[]n I wond[]r what Latitud[] or Longitud[] I'v[] got to?" (Alic[] had no id[]a what Latitud[] was, or Longitud[] []ith[]r, but thought th[]y w[]r[] nic[] grand words to say.)

Pr[]s[]ntly sh[] b[]gan again. "I wond[]r if I shall fall right through th[] []arth! How funny it'll s[][]m to com[] out among th[] p[]opl[] that walk with th[]ir h[]ads downward! Th[] Antipathi[]s, I think -- " (sh[] was rath[]r glad th[]r[] was no on[] list[]ning, this tim[], as it didn't sound at all th[] right word) " -- but I shall hav[] to ask th[]m what th[] nam[] of th[] country is, you know. Pl[]as[], Ma'am, is this N[]w Z[]aland or Australia?" (and sh[] tri[]d to curts[]y as sh[] spok[] -- fancy curts[]ying as you'r[] falling through th[] air! Do you think you could manag[] it?) "And what an ignorant littl[] girl sh[]'ll think m[] for asking! No, it'll n[]v[]r do to ask: p[]rhaps I shall s[][] it writt[]n up som[]wh[]r[]."

Down, down, down. Th[]r[] was nothing []ls[] to do, so Alic[] soon b[]gan talking again. "Dinah'll miss m[] v[]ry much to-night, I should think!" (Dinah was th[] cat.) "I hop[] th[]y'll r[]m[]mb[]r h[]r sauc[]r of milk at t[]a-tim[]. Dinah my d[]ar! I wish you w[]r[] down h[]r[] with m[]! Th[]r[] ar[] no mic[] in th[] air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's v[]ry lik[] a mous[], you know. But do cats []at bats, I wond[]r?" And h[]r[] Alic[] b[]gan to g[]t rath[]r sl[][]py, and w[]nt on saying to h[]rs[]lf, in a dr[]amy sort of way, "Do cats []at bats? Do cats []at bats?" and som[]tim[]s, "Do bats []at cats?" for, you s[][], as sh[] couldn't answ[]r []ith[]r qu[]stion, it didn't much matt[]r which way sh[] put it. Sh[] f[]lt that sh[] was dozing off, and had just b[]gun to dr[]am that sh[] was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to h[]r v[]ry []arn[]stly, "Now, Dinah, t[]ll m[] th[] truth: did you []v[]r []at a bat?" wh[]n sudd[]nly, thump! thump! down sh[] cam[] upon a h[]ap of sticks and dry l[]av[]s, and th[] fall was ov[]r.

Alic[] was not a bit hurt, and sh[] jump[]d up on to h[]r f[][]t in a mom[]nt: sh[] look[]d up, but it was all dark ov[]rh[]ad; b[]for[] h[]r was anoth[]r long passag[], and th[] Whit[] Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. Th[]r[] was not a mom[]nt to b[] lost: away w[]nt Alic[] lik[] th[] wind, and was just in tim[] to h[]ar it say, as it turn[]d a corn[]r, "Oh my []ars and whisk[]rs, how lat[] it's g[]tting!" Sh[] was clos[] b[]hind it wh[]n sh[] turn[]d th[] corn[]r, but th[] Rabbit was no long[]r to b[] s[][]n: sh[] found h[]rs[]lf in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from th[] roof.

Th[]r[] w[]r[] doors all round th[] hall, but th[]y w[]r[] all lock[]d; and wh[]n Alic[] had b[][]n all th[] way down on[] sid[] and up th[] oth[]r, trying []v[]ry door, sh[] walk[]d sadly down th[] middl[], wond[]ring how sh[] was []v[]r to g[]t out again.

Sudd[]nly sh[] cam[] upon a littl[] thr[][]-l[]gg[]d tabl[], all mad[] of solid glass; th[]r[] was nothing on it []xc[]pt a tiny gold[]n k[]y, and Alic[]'s first thought was that it might b[]long to on[] of th[] doors of th[] hall; but, alas! []ith[]r th[] locks w[]r[] too larg[], or th[] k[]y was too small, but at any rat[] it would not op[]n any of th[]m. How[]v[]r, on th[] s[]cond tim[] round, sh[] cam[] upon a low curtain sh[] had not notic[]d b[]for[], and b[]hind it was a littl[] door about fift[][]n inch[]s high: sh[] tri[]d th[] littl[] gold[]n k[]y in th[] lock, and to h[]r gr[]at d[]light it fitt[]d!

Alic[] op[]n[]d th[] door and found that it l[]d into a small passag[], not much larg[]r than a rat-hol[]: sh[] kn[]lt down and look[]d along th[] passag[] into th[] lov[]li[]st gard[]n you []v[]r saw. How sh[] long[]d to g[]t out of that dark hall, and wand[]r about among thos[] b[]ds of bright flow[]rs and thos[] cool fountains, but sh[] could not []v[]n g[]t h[]r h[]ad through th[] doorway; "and []v[]n if my h[]ad would go through," thought poor Alic[], "it would b[] of v[]ry littl[] us[] without my should[]rs. Oh, how I wish I could shut up lik[] a t[]l[]scop[]! I think I could, if I only kn[]w how to b[]gin." For, you s[][], so many out-of-th[]-way things had happ[]n[]d lat[]ly, that Alic[] had b[]gun to think that v[]ry f[]w things ind[][]d w[]r[] r[]ally impossibl[].

Th[]r[] s[][]m[]d to b[] no us[] in waiting by th[] littl[] door, so sh[] w[]nt back to th[] tabl[], half hoping sh[] might find anoth[]r k[]y on it, or at any rat[] a book of rul[]s for shutting p[]opl[] up lik[] t[]l[]scop[]s: this tim[] sh[] found a littl[] bottl[] on it, ("which c[]rtainly was not h[]r[] b[]for[]," said Alic[],) and round th[] n[]ck of th[] bottl[] was a pap[]r lab[]l, with th[] words "DRINK ME," b[]autifully print[]d on it in larg[] l[]tt[]rs.

It was all v[]ry w[]ll to say "Drink m[]," but th[] wis[] littl[] Alic[] was not going to do that in a hurry. "No, I'll look first," sh[] said, "and s[][] wh[]th[]r it's mark[]d 'poison' or not"; for sh[] had r[]ad s[]v[]ral nic[] littl[] histori[]s about childr[]n who had got burnt, and []at[]n up by wild b[]asts and oth[]r unpl[]asant things, all b[]caus[] th[]y would not r[]m[]mb[]r th[] simpl[] rul[]s th[]ir fri[]nds had taught th[]m: such as, that a r[]d-hot pok[]r will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your fing[]r v[]ry d[][]ply with a knif[], it usually bl[][]ds; and sh[] had n[]v[]r forgott[]n that, if you drink much from a bottl[] mark[]d "poison," it is almost c[]rtain to disagr[][] with you, soon[]r or lat[]r.

How[]v[]r, this bottl[] was not mark[]d "poison," so Alic[] v[]ntur[]d to tast[] it, and finding it v[]ry nic[], (it had, in fact, a sort of mix[]d flavour of ch[]rry-tart, custard, pin[]-appl[], roast turk[]y, toff[][], and hot butt[]r[]d toast,) sh[] v[]ry soon finish[]d it off.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *
"What a curious f[][]ling!" said Alic[]; "I must b[] shutting up lik[] a t[]l[]scop[]."

And so it was ind[][]d: sh[] was now only t[]n inch[]s high, and h[]r fac[] bright[]n[]d up at th[] thought that sh[] was now th[] right siz[] for going through th[] littl[] door into that lov[]ly gard[]n. First, how[]v[]r, sh[] wait[]d for a f[]w minut[]s to s[][] if sh[] was going to shrink any furth[]r: sh[] f[]lt a littl[] n[]rvous about this; "for it might []nd, you know," said Alic[] to h[]rs[]lf, "in my going out altog[]th[]r, lik[] a candl[]. I wond[]r what I should b[] lik[] th[]n?" And sh[] tri[]d to fancy what th[] flam[] of a candl[] is lik[] aft[]r th[] candl[] is blown out, for sh[] could not r[]m[]mb[]r []v[]r having s[][]n such a thing.

Aft[]r a whil[], finding that nothing mor[] happ[]n[]d, sh[] d[]cid[]d on going into th[] gard[]n at onc[]; but, alas for poor Alic[]! wh[]n sh[] got to th[] door, sh[] found sh[] had forgott[]n th[] littl[] gold[]n k[]y, and wh[]n sh[] w[]nt back to th[] tabl[] for it, sh[] found sh[] could not possibly r[]ach it: sh[] could s[][] it quit[] plainly through th[] glass, and sh[] tri[]d h[]r b[]st to climb up on[] of th[] l[]gs of th[] tabl[], but it was too slipp[]ry; and wh[]n sh[] had tir[]d h[]rs[]lf out with trying, th[] poor littl[] thing sat down and cri[]d.

"Com[], th[]r[]'s no us[] in crying lik[] that!" said Alic[] to h[]rs[]lf, rath[]r sharply; "I advis[] you to l[]av[] off this minut[]!" Sh[] g[]n[]rally gav[] h[]rs[]lf v[]ry good advic[], (though sh[] v[]ry s[]ldom follow[]d it), and som[]tim[]s sh[] scold[]d h[]rs[]lf so s[]v[]r[]ly as to bring t[]ars into h[]r []y[]s; and onc[] sh[] r[]m[]mb[]r[]d trying to box h[]r own []ars for having ch[]at[]d h[]rs[]lf in a gam[] of croqu[]t sh[] was playing against h[]rs[]lf, for this curious child was v[]ry fond of pr[]t[]nding to b[] two p[]opl[]. "But it's no us[] now," thought poor Alic[], "to pr[]t[]nd to b[] two p[]opl[]! Why, th[]r[]'s hardly []nough of m[] l[]ft to mak[] on[] r[]sp[]ctabl[] p[]rson!"

Soon h[]r []y[] f[]ll on a littl[] glass box that was lying und[]r th[] tabl[]: sh[] op[]n[]d it, and found in it a v[]ry small cak[], on which th[] words "EAT ME" w[]r[] b[]autifully mark[]d in currants. "W[]ll, I'll []at it," said Alic[], "and if it mak[]s m[] grow larg[]r, I can r[]ach th[] k[]y; and if it mak[]s m[] grow small[]r, I can cr[][]p und[]r th[] door; so []ith[]r way I'll g[]t into th[] gard[]n, and I don't car[] which happ[]ns!"

Sh[] at[] a littl[] bit, and said anxiously to h[]rs[]lf, "Which way? Which way?", holding h[]r hand on th[] top of h[]r h[]ad to f[][]l which way it was growing, and sh[] was quit[] surpris[]d to find that sh[] r[]main[]d th[] sam[] siz[]: to b[] sur[], this g[]n[]rally happ[]ns wh[]n on[] []ats cak[], but Alic[] had got so much into th[] way of []xp[]cting nothing but out-of-th[]-way things to happ[]n, that it s[][]m[]d quit[] dull and stupid for lif[] to go on in th[] common way.

So sh[] s[]t to work, and v[]ry soon finish[]d off th[] cak[].

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *
CHAPTER II.
Th[] Pool of T[]ars
"Curious[]r and curious[]r!" cri[]d Alic[] (sh[] was so much surpris[]d, that for th[] mom[]nt sh[] quit[] forgot how to sp[]ak good English); "now I'm op[]ning out lik[] th[] larg[]st t[]l[]scop[] that []v[]r was! Good-by[], f[][]t!" (for wh[]n sh[] look[]d down at h[]r f[][]t, th[]y s[][]m[]d to b[] almost out of sight, th[]y w[]r[] g[]tting so far off). "Oh, my poor littl[] f[][]t, I wond[]r who will put on your sho[]s and stockings for you now, d[]ars? I'm sur[] I shan't b[] abl[]! I shall b[] a gr[]at d[]al too far off to troubl[] mys[]lf about you: you must manag[] th[] b[]st way you can; -- but I must b[] kind to th[]m," thought Alic[], "or p[]rhaps th[]y won't walk th[] way I want to go! L[]t m[] s[][]: I'll giv[] th[]m a n[]w pair of boots []v[]ry Christmas."

And sh[] w[]nt on planning to h[]rs[]lf how sh[] would manag[] it. "Th[]y must go by th[] carri[]r," sh[] thought; "and how funny it'll s[][]m, s[]nding pr[]s[]nts to on[]'s own f[][]t! And how odd th[] dir[]ctions will look!

     Alic[]'s Right Foot, Esq.,
       H[]arthrug,
         n[]ar th[] F[]nd[]r,
           (with Alic[]'s lov[]).
Oh d[]ar, what nons[]ns[] I'm talking!"

Just th[]n h[]r h[]ad struck against th[] roof of th[] hall: in fact sh[] was now mor[] than nin[] f[][]t high, and sh[] at onc[] took up th[] littl[] gold[]n k[]y and hurri[]d off to th[] gard[]n door.

Poor Alic[]! It was as much as sh[] could do, lying down on on[] sid[], to look through into th[] gard[]n with on[] []y[]; but to g[]t through was mor[] hop[]l[]ss than []v[]r: sh[] sat down and b[]gan to cry again.

"You ought to b[] asham[]d of yours[]lf," said Alic[], "a gr[]at girl lik[] you," (sh[] might w[]ll say this), "to go on crying in this way! Stop this mom[]nt, I t[]ll you!" But sh[] w[]nt on all th[] sam[], sh[]dding gallons of t[]ars, until th[]r[] was a larg[] pool all round h[]r, about four inch[]s d[][]p and r[]aching half down th[] hall.

Aft[]r a tim[] sh[] h[]ard a littl[] patt[]ring of f[][]t in th[] distanc[], and sh[] hastily dri[]d h[]r []y[]s to s[][] what was coming. It was th[] Whit[] Rabbit r[]turning, spl[]ndidly dr[]ss[]d, with a pair of whit[] kid glov[]s in on[] hand and a larg[] fan in th[] oth[]r: h[] cam[] trotting along in a gr[]at hurry, mutt[]ring to hims[]lf as h[] cam[], "Oh! th[] Duch[]ss, th[] Duch[]ss! Oh! won't sh[] b[] savag[] if I'v[] k[]pt h[]r waiting!" Alic[] f[]lt so d[]sp[]rat[] that sh[] was r[]ady to ask h[]lp of any on[]; so, wh[]n th[] Rabbit cam[] n[]ar h[]r, sh[] b[]gan, in a low, timid voic[], "If you pl[]as[], sir -- " Th[] Rabbit start[]d viol[]ntly, dropp[]d th[] whit[] kid glov[]s and th[] fan, and skurri[]d away into th[] darkn[]ss as hard as h[] could go.

Alic[] took up th[] fan and glov[]s, and, as th[] hall was v[]ry hot, sh[] k[]pt fanning h[]rs[]lf all th[] tim[] sh[] w[]nt on talking: "D[]ar, d[]ar! How qu[][]r []v[]rything is to-day! And y[]st[]rday things w[]nt on just as usual. I wond[]r if I'v[] b[][]n chang[]d in th[] night? L[]t m[] think: was I th[] sam[] wh[]n I got up this morning? I almost think I can r[]m[]mb[]r f[][]ling a littl[] diff[]r[]nt. But if I'm not th[] sam[], th[] n[]xt qu[]stion is, Who in th[] world am I? Ah, that's th[] gr[]at puzzl[]!" And sh[] b[]gan thinking ov[]r all th[] childr[]n sh[] kn[]w that w[]r[] of th[] sam[] ag[] as h[]rs[]lf, to s[][] if sh[] could hav[] b[][]n chang[]d for any of th[]m.

"I'm sur[] I'm not Ada," sh[] said, "for h[]r hair go[]s in such long ringl[]ts, and min[] do[]sn't go in ringl[]ts at all; and I'm sur[] I can't b[] Mab[]l, for I know all sorts of things, and sh[], oh! sh[] knows such a v[]ry littl[]! B[]sid[]s, sh[]'s sh[], and I'm I, and -- oh d[]ar, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all th[] things I us[]d to know. L[]t m[] s[][]: four tim[]s fiv[] is tw[]lv[], and four tim[]s six is thirt[][]n, and four tim[]s s[]v[]n is -- oh d[]ar! I shall n[]v[]r g[]t to tw[]nty at that rat[]! How[]v[]r, th[] Multiplication Tabl[] do[]sn't signify: l[]t's try G[]ography. London is th[] capital of Paris, and Paris is th[] capital of Rom[], and Rom[] -- no, that's all wrong, I'm c[]rtain! I must hav[] b[][]n chang[]d for Mab[]l! I'll try and say 'How doth th[] littl[] -- '" and sh[] cross[]d h[]r hands on h[]r lap as if sh[] w[]r[] saying l[]ssons, and b[]gan to r[]p[]at it, but h[]r voic[] sound[]d hoars[] and strang[], and th[] words did not com[] th[] sam[] as th[]y us[]d to do: -- 

"How doth th[] littl[] crocodil[]
    Improv[] his shining tail,
And pour th[] wat[]rs of th[] Nil[]
    On []v[]ry gold[]n scal[]!

"How ch[][]rfully h[] s[][]ms to grin,
    How n[]atly spr[]ad his claws,
And w[]lcom[] littl[] fish[]s in
    With g[]ntly smiling jaws!"

"I'm sur[] thos[] ar[] not th[] right words," said poor Alic[], and h[]r []y[]s fill[]d with t[]ars again as sh[] w[]nt on, "I must b[] Mab[]l aft[]r all, and I shall hav[] to go and liv[] in that poky littl[] hous[], and hav[] n[]xt to no toys to play with, and oh! []v[]r so many l[]ssons to l[]arn! No, I'v[] mad[] up my mind about it; if I'm Mab[]l, I'll stay down h[]r[]! It'll b[] no us[] th[]ir putting th[]ir h[]ads down and saying 'Com[] up again, d[]ar!' I shall only look up and say 'Who am I th[]n? T[]ll m[] that first, and th[]n, if I lik[] b[]ing that p[]rson, I'll com[] up: if not, I'll stay down h[]r[] till I'm som[]body []ls[]' -- but, oh d[]ar!" cri[]d Alic[], with a sudd[]n burst of t[]ars, "I do wish th[]y would put th[]ir h[]ads down! I am so v[]ry tir[]d of b[]ing all alon[] h[]r[]!"

As sh[] said this sh[] look[]d down at h[]r hands, and was surpris[]d to s[][] that sh[] had put on on[] of th[] Rabbit's littl[] whit[] kid glov[]s whil[] sh[] was talking. "How can I hav[] don[] that?" sh[] thought. "I must b[] growing small again." Sh[] got up and w[]nt to th[] tabl[] to m[]asur[] h[]rs[]lf by it, and found that, as n[]arly as sh[] could gu[]ss, sh[] was now about two f[][]t high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: sh[] soon found out that th[] caus[] of this was th[] fan sh[] was holding, and sh[] dropp[]d it hastily, just in tim[] to avoid shrinking away altog[]th[]r.

"That was a narrow []scap[]!" said Alic[], a good d[]al fright[]n[]d at th[] sudd[]n chang[], but v[]ry glad to find h[]rs[]lf still in []xist[]nc[]; "and now for th[] gard[]n!" and sh[] ran with all sp[][]d back to th[] littl[] door: but, alas! th[] littl[] door was shut again, and th[] littl[] gold[]n k[]y was lying on th[] glass tabl[] as b[]for[], "and things ar[] wors[] than []v[]r," thought th[] poor child, "for I n[]v[]r was so small as this b[]for[], n[]v[]r! And I d[]clar[] it's too bad, that it is!"

As sh[] said th[]s[] words h[]r foot slipp[]d, and in anoth[]r mom[]nt, splash! sh[] was up to h[]r chin in salt wat[]r. H[]r first id[]a was that sh[] had som[]how fall[]n into th[] s[]a, "and in that cas[] I can go back by railway," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf. (Alic[] had b[][]n to th[] s[]asid[] onc[] in h[]r lif[], and had com[] to th[] g[]n[]ral conclusion, that wh[]r[]v[]r you go to on th[] English coast you find a numb[]r of bathing machin[]s in th[] s[]a, som[] childr[]n digging in th[] sand with wood[]n spad[]s, th[]n a row of lodging hous[]s, and b[]hind th[]m a railway station.) How[]v[]r, sh[] soon mad[] out that sh[] was in th[] pool of t[]ars which sh[] had w[]pt wh[]n sh[] was nin[] f[][]t high.

"I wish I hadn't cri[]d so much!" said Alic[], as sh[] swam about, trying to find h[]r way out. "I shall b[] punish[]d for it now, I suppos[], by b[]ing drown[]d in my own t[]ars! That will b[] a qu[][]r thing, to b[] sur[]! How[]v[]r, []v[]rything is qu[][]r to-day."

Just th[]n sh[] h[]ard som[]thing splashing about in th[] pool a littl[] way off, and sh[] swam n[]ar[]r to mak[] out what it was: at first sh[] thought it must b[] a walrus or hippopotamus, but th[]n sh[] r[]m[]mb[]r[]d how small sh[] was now, and sh[] soon mad[] out that it was only a mous[] that had slipp[]d in lik[] h[]rs[]lf.

"Would it b[] of any us[], now," thought Alic[], "to sp[]ak to this mous[]? Ev[]rything is so out-of-th[]-way down h[]r[], that I should think v[]ry lik[]ly it can talk: at any rat[], th[]r[]'s no harm in trying." So sh[] b[]gan: "O Mous[], do you know th[] way out of this pool? I am v[]ry tir[]d of swimming about h[]r[], O Mous[]!" (Alic[] thought this must b[] th[] right way of sp[]aking to a mous[]: sh[] had n[]v[]r don[] such a thing b[]for[], but sh[] r[]m[]mb[]r[]d having s[][]n in h[]r broth[]r's Latin Grammar, "A mous[] -- of a mous[] -- to a mous[] -- a mous[] -- O mous[]!") Th[] Mous[] look[]d at h[]r rath[]r inquisitiv[]ly, and s[][]m[]d to h[]r to wink with on[] of its littl[] []y[]s, but it said nothing.

"P[]rhaps it do[]sn't und[]rstand English," thought Alic[]; "I dar[]say it's a Fr[]nch mous[], com[] ov[]r with William th[] Conqu[]ror." (For, with all h[]r knowl[]dg[] of history, Alic[] had no v[]ry cl[]ar notion how long ago anything had happ[]n[]d.) So sh[] b[]gan again: "Où []st ma chatt[]?" which was th[] first s[]nt[]nc[] in h[]r Fr[]nch l[]sson-book. Th[] Mous[] gav[] a sudd[]n l[]ap out of th[] wat[]r, and s[][]m[]d to quiv[]r all ov[]r with fright. "Oh, I b[]g your pardon!" cri[]d Alic[] hastily, afraid that sh[] had hurt th[] poor animal's f[][]lings. "I quit[] forgot you didn't lik[] cats."

"Not lik[] cats!" cri[]d th[] Mous[], in a shrill, passionat[] voic[]. "Would you lik[] cats if you w[]r[] m[]?"

"W[]ll, p[]rhaps not," said Alic[] in a soothing ton[]: "don't b[] angry about it. And y[]t I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd tak[] a fancy to cats if you could only s[][] h[]r. Sh[] is such a d[]ar qui[]t thing," Alic[] w[]nt on, half to h[]rs[]lf, as sh[] swam lazily about in th[] pool, "and sh[] sits purring so nic[]ly by th[] fir[], licking h[]r paws and washing h[]r fac[] -- and sh[] is such a nic[] soft thing to nurs[] -- and sh[]'s such a capital on[] for catching mic[] -- oh, I b[]g your pardon!" cri[]d Alic[] again, for this tim[] th[] Mous[] was bristling all ov[]r, and sh[] f[]lt c[]rtain it must b[] r[]ally off[]nd[]d. "W[] won't talk about h[]r any mor[] if you'd rath[]r not."

"W[] ind[][]d!" cri[]d th[] Mous[], who was tr[]mbling down to th[] []nd of his tail. "As if I would talk on such a subj[]ct! Our family always hat[]d cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't l[]t m[] h[]ar th[] nam[] again!"

"I won't ind[][]d!" said Alic[], in a gr[]at hurry to chang[] th[] subj[]ct of conv[]rsation. "Ar[] you -- ar[] you fond -- of -- of dogs?" Th[] Mous[] did not answ[]r, so Alic[] w[]nt on []ag[]rly: "Th[]r[] is such a nic[] littl[] dog n[]ar our hous[] I should lik[] to show you! A littl[] bright-[]y[]d t[]rri[]r, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll f[]tch things wh[]n you throw th[]m, and it'll sit up and b[]g for its dinn[]r, and all sorts of things -- I can't r[]m[]mb[]r half of th[]m -- and it b[]longs to a farm[]r, you know, and h[] says it's so us[]ful, it's worth a hundr[]d pounds! H[] says it kills all th[] rats and -- oh d[]ar!" cri[]d Alic[] in a sorrowful ton[], "I'm afraid I'v[] off[]nd[]d it again!" For th[] Mous[] was swimming away from h[]r as hard as it could go, and making quit[] a commotion in th[] pool as it w[]nt.

So sh[] call[]d softly aft[]r it, "Mous[] d[]ar! Do com[] back again, and w[] won't talk about cats or dogs []ith[]r, if you don't lik[] th[]m!" Wh[]n th[] Mous[] h[]ard this, it turn[]d round and swam slowly back to h[]r: its fac[] was quit[] pal[] (with passion, Alic[] thought), and it said in a low tr[]mbling voic[], "L[]t us g[]t to th[] shor[], and th[]n I'll t[]ll you my history, and you'll und[]rstand why it is I hat[] cats and dogs."

It was high tim[] to go, for th[] pool was g[]tting quit[] crowd[]d with th[] birds and animals that had fall[]n into it: th[]r[] w[]r[] a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eagl[]t, and s[]v[]ral oth[]r curious cr[]atur[]s. Alic[] l[]d th[] way, and th[] whol[] party swam to th[] shor[].

CHAPTER III.
A Caucus-Rac[] and a Long Tal[]
Th[]y w[]r[] ind[][]d a qu[][]r-looking party that ass[]mbl[]d on th[] bank -- th[] birds with draggl[]d f[]ath[]rs, th[] animals with th[]ir fur clinging clos[] to th[]m, and all dripping w[]t, cross, and uncomfortabl[].

Th[] first qu[]stion of cours[] was, how to g[]t dry again: th[]y had a consultation about this, and aft[]r a f[]w minut[]s it s[][]m[]d quit[] natural to Alic[] to find h[]rs[]lf talking familiarly with th[]m, as if sh[] had known th[]m all h[]r lif[]. Ind[][]d, sh[] had quit[] a long argum[]nt with th[] Lory, who at last turn[]d sulky, and would only say, "I am old[]r than you, and must know b[]tt[]r;" and this Alic[] would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as th[] Lory positiv[]ly r[]fus[]d to t[]ll its ag[], th[]r[] was no mor[] to b[] said.

At last th[] Mous[], who s[][]m[]d to b[] a p[]rson of authority among th[]m, call[]d out, "Sit down, all of you, and list[]n to m[]! I'll soon mak[] you dry []nough!" Th[]y all sat down at onc[], in a larg[] ring, with th[] Mous[] in th[] middl[]. Alic[] k[]pt h[]r []y[]s anxiously fix[]d on it, for sh[] f[]lt sur[] sh[] would catch a bad cold if sh[] did not g[]t dry v[]ry soon.

"Ah[]m!" said th[] Mous[] with an important air, "ar[] you all r[]ady? This is th[] dri[]st thing I know. Sil[]nc[] all round, if you pl[]as[]! 'William th[] Conqu[]ror, whos[] caus[] was favour[]d by th[] pop[], was soon submitt[]d to by th[] English, who want[]d l[]ad[]rs, and had b[][]n of lat[] much accustom[]d to usurpation and conqu[]st. Edwin and Morcar, th[] []arls of M[]rcia and Northumbria -- '"

"Ugh!" said th[] Lory, with a shiv[]r.

"I b[]g your pardon!" said th[] Mous[], frowning, but v[]ry polit[]ly: "Did you sp[]ak?"

"Not I!" said th[] Lory hastily.

"I thought you did," said th[] Mous[]. " -- I proc[][]d. 'Edwin and Morcar, th[] []arls of M[]rcia and Northumbria, d[]clar[]d for him: and []v[]n Stigand, th[] patriotic archbishop of Cant[]rbury, found it advisabl[] -- '"

"Found what?" said th[] Duck.

"Found it," th[] Mous[] r[]pli[]d rath[]r crossly: "of cours[] you know what 'it' m[]ans."

"I know what 'it' m[]ans w[]ll []nough, wh[]n I find a thing," said th[] Duck: "it's g[]n[]rally a frog or a worm. Th[] qu[]stion is, what did th[] archbishop find?"

Th[] Mous[] did not notic[] this qu[]stion, but hurri[]dly w[]nt on, "' -- found it advisabl[] to go with Edgar Ath[]ling to m[][]t William and off[]r him th[] crown. William's conduct at first was mod[]rat[]. But th[] insol[]nc[] of his Normans -- ' How ar[] you g[]tting on now, my d[]ar?" it continu[]d, turning to Alic[] as it spok[].

"As w[]t as []v[]r," said Alic[] in a m[]lancholy ton[]: "it do[]sn't s[][]m to dry m[] at all."

"In that cas[]," said th[] Dodo sol[]mnly, rising to its f[][]t, "I mov[] that th[] m[][]ting adjourn, for th[] imm[]diat[] adoption of mor[] []n[]rg[]tic r[]m[]di[]s -- "

"Sp[]ak English!" said th[] Eagl[]t. "I don't know th[] m[]aning of half thos[] long words, and, what's mor[], I don't b[]li[]v[] you do []ith[]r!" And th[] Eagl[]t b[]nt down its h[]ad to hid[] a smil[]: som[] of th[] oth[]r birds titt[]r[]d audibly.

"What I was going to say," said th[] Dodo in an off[]nd[]d ton[], "was, that th[] b[]st thing to g[]t us dry would b[] a Caucus-rac[]."

"What is a Caucus-rac[]?" said Alic[]; not that sh[] want[]d much to know, but th[] Dodo had paus[]d as if it thought that som[]body ought to sp[]ak, and no on[] []ls[] s[][]m[]d inclin[]d to say anything.

"Why," said th[] Dodo, "th[] b[]st way to []xplain it is to do it." (And, as you might lik[] to try th[] thing yours[]lf, som[] wint[]r day, I will t[]ll you how th[] Dodo manag[]d it.)

First it mark[]d out a rac[]-cours[], in a sort of circl[], ("th[] []xact shap[] do[]sn't matt[]r," it said,) and th[]n all th[] party w[]r[] plac[]d along th[] cours[], h[]r[] and th[]r[]. Th[]r[] was no "On[], two, thr[][], and away," but th[]y b[]gan running wh[]n th[]y lik[]d, and l[]ft off wh[]n th[]y lik[]d, so that it was not []asy to know wh[]n th[] rac[] was ov[]r. How[]v[]r, wh[]n th[]y had b[][]n running half an hour or so, and w[]r[] quit[] dry again, th[] Dodo sudd[]nly call[]d out "Th[] rac[] is ov[]r!" and th[]y all crowd[]d round it, panting, and asking, "But who has won?"

This qu[]stion th[] Dodo could not answ[]r without a gr[]at d[]al of thought, and it sat for a long tim[] with on[] fing[]r pr[]ss[]d upon its for[]h[]ad (th[] position in which you usually s[][] Shak[]sp[]ar[], in th[] pictur[]s of him), whil[] th[] r[]st wait[]d in sil[]nc[]. At last th[] Dodo said, "Ev[]rybody has won, and all must hav[] priz[]s."

"But who is to giv[] th[] priz[]s?" quit[] a chorus of voic[]s ask[]d.

"Why, sh[], of cours[]," said th[] Dodo, pointing to Alic[] with on[] fing[]r; and th[] whol[] party at onc[] crowd[]d round h[]r, calling out in a confus[]d way, "Priz[]s! Priz[]s!"

Alic[] had no id[]a what to do, and in d[]spair sh[] put h[]r hand in h[]r pock[]t, and pull[]d out a box of comfits, (luckily th[] salt wat[]r had not got into it), and hand[]d th[]m round as priz[]s. Th[]r[] was []xactly on[] a-pi[]c[], all round.

"But sh[] must hav[] a priz[] h[]rs[]lf, you know," said th[] Mous[].

"Of cours[]," th[] Dodo r[]pli[]d v[]ry grav[]ly. "What []ls[] hav[] you got in your pock[]t?" h[] w[]nt on, turning to Alic[].

"Only a thimbl[]," said Alic[] sadly.

"Hand it ov[]r h[]r[]," said th[] Dodo.

Th[]n th[]y all crowd[]d round h[]r onc[] mor[], whil[] th[] Dodo sol[]mnly pr[]s[]nt[]d th[] thimbl[], saying "W[] b[]g your acc[]ptanc[] of this []l[]gant thimbl[];" and, wh[]n it had finish[]d this short sp[][]ch, th[]y all ch[][]r[]d.

Alic[] thought th[] whol[] thing v[]ry absurd, but th[]y all look[]d so grav[] that sh[] did not dar[] to laugh; and, as sh[] could not think of anything to say, sh[] simply bow[]d, and took th[] thimbl[], looking as sol[]mn as sh[] could.

Th[] n[]xt thing was to []at th[] comfits: this caus[]d som[] nois[] and confusion, as th[] larg[] birds complain[]d that th[]y could not tast[] th[]irs, and th[] small on[]s chok[]d and had to b[] patt[]d on th[] back. How[]v[]r, it was ov[]r at last, and th[]y sat down again in a ring, and b[]gg[]d th[] Mous[] to t[]ll th[]m som[]thing mor[].

"You promis[]d to t[]ll m[] your history, you know," said Alic[], "and why it is you hat[] -- C and D," sh[] add[]d in a whisp[]r, half afraid that it would b[] off[]nd[]d again.

"Min[] is a long and a sad tal[]!" said th[] Mous[], turning to Alic[], and sighing.

"It is a long tail, c[]rtainly," said Alic[], looking down with wond[]r at th[] Mous[]'s tail; "but why do you call it sad?" And sh[] k[]pt on puzzling about it whil[] th[] Mous[] was sp[]aking, so that h[]r id[]a of th[] tal[] was som[]thing lik[] this: -- 

         "Fury said to a
         mous[], That h[]
        m[]t in th[]
       hous[],
     'L[]t us
      both go to
       law: I will
        pros[]cut[]
         you. -- Com[],
           I'll tak[] no
           d[]nial; W[]
          must hav[] a
        trial: For
      r[]ally this
     morning I'v[]
    nothing
    to do.'
      Said th[]
      mous[] to th[]
       cur, 'Such
        a trial,
         d[]ar sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judg[],
       would b[]
      wasting
      our
      br[]ath.'
        'I'll b[]
        judg[], I'll
         b[] jury,'
             Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          'I'll
          try th[]
            whol[]
            caus[],
              and
           cond[]mn
           you
          to
           d[]ath.'"
"You ar[] not att[]nding!" said th[] Mous[] to Alic[] s[]v[]r[]ly. "What ar[] you thinking of?"

"I b[]g your pardon," said Alic[] v[]ry humbly: "you had got to th[] fifth b[]nd, I think?"

"I had not!" cri[]d th[] Mous[], sharply and v[]ry angrily.

"A knot!" said Alic[], always r[]ady to mak[] h[]rs[]lf us[]ful, and looking anxiously about h[]r. "Oh, do l[]t m[] h[]lp to undo it!"

"I shall do nothing of th[] sort," said th[] Mous[], g[]tting up and walking away. "You insult m[] by talking such nons[]ns[]!"

"I didn't m[]an it!" pl[]ad[]d poor Alic[]. "But you'r[] so []asily off[]nd[]d, you know!"

Th[] Mous[] only growl[]d in r[]ply.

"Pl[]as[] com[] back and finish your story!" Alic[] call[]d aft[]r it; and th[] oth[]rs all join[]d in chorus, "Y[]s, pl[]as[] do!" but th[] Mous[] only shook its h[]ad impati[]ntly, and walk[]d a littl[] quick[]r.

"What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sigh[]d th[] Lory, as soon as it was quit[] out of sight; and an old Crab took th[] opportunity of saying to h[]r daught[]r "Ah, my d[]ar! L[]t this b[] a l[]sson to you n[]v[]r to los[] your t[]mp[]r!" "Hold your tongu[], Ma!" said th[] young Crab, a littl[] snappishly. "You'r[] []nough to try th[] pati[]nc[] of an oyst[]r!"

"I wish I had our Dinah h[]r[], I know I do!" said Alic[] aloud, addr[]ssing nobody in particular. "Sh[]'d soon f[]tch it back!"

"And who is Dinah, if I might v[]ntur[] to ask th[] qu[]stion?" said th[] Lory.

Alic[] r[]pli[]d []ag[]rly, for sh[] was always r[]ady to talk about h[]r p[]t: "Dinah's our cat. And sh[]'s such a capital on[] for catching mic[] you can't think! And oh, I wish you could s[][] h[]r aft[]r th[] birds! Why, sh[]'ll []at a littl[] bird as soon as look at it!"

This sp[][]ch caus[]d a r[]markabl[] s[]nsation among th[] party. Som[] of th[] birds hurri[]d off at onc[]: on[] old Magpi[] b[]gan wrapping its[]lf up v[]ry car[]fully, r[]marking, "I r[]ally must b[] g[]tting hom[]; th[] night-air do[]sn't suit my throat!" and a Canary call[]d out in a tr[]mbling voic[] to its childr[]n, "Com[] away, my d[]ars! It's high tim[] you w[]r[] all in b[]d!" On various pr[]t[]xts th[]y all mov[]d off, and Alic[] was soon l[]ft alon[].

"I wish I hadn't m[]ntion[]d Dinah!" sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf in a m[]lancholy ton[]. "Nobody s[][]ms to lik[] h[]r, down h[]r[], and I'm sur[] sh[]'s th[] b[]st cat in th[] world! Oh, my d[]ar Dinah! I wond[]r if I shall []v[]r s[][] you any mor[]!" And h[]r[] poor Alic[] b[]gan to cry again, for sh[] f[]lt v[]ry lon[]ly and low-spirit[]d. In a littl[] whil[], how[]v[]r, sh[] again h[]ard a littl[] patt[]ring of footst[]ps in th[] distanc[], and sh[] look[]d up []ag[]rly, half hoping that th[] Mous[] had chang[]d his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.

CHAPTER IV.
Th[] Rabbit S[]nds in a Littl[] Bill
It was th[] Whit[] Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it w[]nt, as if it had lost som[]thing; and sh[] h[]ard it mutt[]ring to its[]lf "Th[] Duch[]ss! Th[] Duch[]ss! Oh my d[]ar paws! Oh my fur and whisk[]rs! Sh[]'ll g[]t m[] []x[]cut[]d, as sur[] as f[]rr[]ts ar[] f[]rr[]ts! Wh[]r[] can I hav[] dropp[]d th[]m, I wond[]r?" Alic[] gu[]ss[]d in a mom[]nt that it was looking for th[] fan and th[] pair of whit[] kid glov[]s, and sh[] v[]ry good-natur[]dly b[]gan hunting about for th[]m, but th[]y w[]r[] nowh[]r[] to b[] s[][]n -- []v[]rything s[][]m[]d to hav[] chang[]d sinc[] h[]r swim in th[] pool, and th[] gr[]at hall, with th[] glass tabl[] and th[] littl[] door, had vanish[]d compl[]t[]ly.

V[]ry soon th[] Rabbit notic[]d Alic[], as sh[] w[]nt hunting about, and call[]d out to h[]r in an angry ton[], "Why, Mary Ann, what ar[] you doing out h[]r[]? Run hom[] this mom[]nt, and f[]tch m[] a pair of glov[]s and a fan! Quick, now!" And Alic[] was so much fright[]n[]d that sh[] ran off at onc[] in th[] dir[]ction it point[]d to, without trying to []xplain th[] mistak[] it had mad[].

"H[] took m[] for his hous[]maid," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf as sh[] ran. "How surpris[]d h[]'ll b[] wh[]n h[] finds out who I am! But I'd b[]tt[]r tak[] him his fan and glov[]s -- that is, if I can find th[]m." As sh[] said this, sh[] cam[] upon a n[]at littl[] hous[], on th[] door of which was a bright brass plat[] with th[] nam[] "W. RABBIT," []ngrav[]d upon it. Sh[] w[]nt in without knocking, and hurri[]d upstairs, in gr[]at f[]ar l[]st sh[] should m[][]t th[] r[]al Mary Ann, and b[] turn[]d out of th[] hous[] b[]for[] sh[] had found th[] fan and glov[]s.

"How qu[][]r it s[][]ms," Alic[] said to h[]rs[]lf, "to b[] going m[]ssag[]s for a rabbit! I suppos[] Dinah'll b[] s[]nding m[] on m[]ssag[]s n[]xt!" And sh[] b[]gan fancying th[] sort of thing that would happ[]n: "'Miss Alic[]! Com[] h[]r[] dir[]ctly, and g[]t r[]ady for your walk!' 'Coming in a minut[], nurs[]! But I'v[] got to s[][] that th[] mous[] do[]sn't g[]t out.' Only I don't think," Alic[] w[]nt on, "that th[]y'd l[]t Dinah stop in th[] hous[] if it b[]gan ord[]ring p[]opl[] about lik[] that!"

By this tim[] sh[] had found h[]r way into a tidy littl[] room with a tabl[] in th[] window, and on it (as sh[] had hop[]d) a fan and two or thr[][] pairs of tiny whit[] kid glov[]s: sh[] took up th[] fan and a pair of th[] glov[]s, and was just going to l[]av[] th[] room, wh[]n h[]r []y[] f[]ll upon a littl[] bottl[] that stood n[]ar th[] looking-glass. Th[]r[] was no lab[]l this tim[] with th[] words "DRINK ME," but n[]v[]rth[]l[]ss sh[] uncork[]d it and put it to h[]r lips. "I know som[]thing int[]r[]sting is sur[] to happ[]n," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf, "wh[]n[]v[]r I []at or drink anything; so I'll just s[][] what this bottl[] do[]s. I do hop[] it'll mak[] m[] grow larg[] again, for r[]ally I'm quit[] tir[]d of b[]ing such a tiny littl[] thing!"

It did so ind[][]d, and much soon[]r than sh[] had []xp[]ct[]d: b[]for[] sh[] had drunk half th[] bottl[], sh[] found h[]r h[]ad pr[]ssing against th[] c[]iling, and had to stoop to sav[] h[]r n[]ck from b[]ing brok[]n. Sh[] hastily put down th[] bottl[], saying to h[]rs[]lf "That's quit[] []nough -- I hop[] I shan't grow any mor[] -- As it is, I can't g[]t out at th[] door -- I do wish I hadn't drunk quit[] so much!"

Alas! it was too lat[] to wish that! Sh[] w[]nt on growing, and growing, and v[]ry soon had to kn[][]l down on th[] floor: in anoth[]r minut[] th[]r[] was not []v[]n room for this, and sh[] tri[]d th[] []ff[]ct of lying down with on[] []lbow against th[] door, and th[] oth[]r arm curl[]d round h[]r h[]ad. Still sh[] w[]nt on growing, and, as a last r[]sourc[], sh[] put on[] arm out of th[] window, and on[] foot up th[] chimn[]y, and said to h[]rs[]lf "Now I can do no mor[], what[]v[]r happ[]ns. What will b[]com[] of m[]?"

Luckily for Alic[], th[] littl[] magic bottl[] had now had its full []ff[]ct, and sh[] gr[]w no larg[]r: still it was v[]ry uncomfortabl[], and, as th[]r[] s[][]m[]d to b[] no sort of chanc[] of h[]r []v[]r g[]tting out of th[] room again, no wond[]r sh[] f[]lt unhappy.

"It was much pl[]asant[]r at hom[]," thought poor Alic[], "wh[]n on[] wasn't always growing larg[]r and small[]r, and b[]ing ord[]r[]d about by mic[] and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gon[] down that rabbit-hol[] -- and y[]t -- and y[]t -- it's rath[]r curious, you know, this sort of lif[]! I do wond[]r what can hav[] happ[]n[]d to m[]! Wh[]n I us[]d to r[]ad fairy-tal[]s, I fanci[]d that kind of thing n[]v[]r happ[]n[]d, and now h[]r[] I am in th[] middl[] of on[]! Th[]r[] ought to b[] a book writt[]n about m[], that th[]r[] ought! And wh[]n I grow up, I'll writ[] on[] -- but I'm grown up now," sh[] add[]d in a sorrowful ton[]; "at l[]ast th[]r[]'s no room to grow up any mor[] h[]r[]."

"But th[]n," thought Alic[], "shall I n[]v[]r g[]t any old[]r than I am now? That'll b[] a comfort, on[] way -- n[]v[]r to b[] an old woman -- but th[]n -- always to hav[] l[]ssons to l[]arn! Oh, I shouldn't lik[] that!"

"Oh, you foolish Alic[]!" sh[] answ[]r[]d h[]rs[]lf. "How can you l[]arn l[]ssons in h[]r[]? Why, th[]r[]'s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any l[]sson-books!"

And so sh[] w[]nt on, taking first on[] sid[] and th[]n th[] oth[]r, and making quit[] a conv[]rsation of it altog[]th[]r; but aft[]r a f[]w minut[]s sh[] h[]ard a voic[] outsid[], and stopp[]d to list[]n.

"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!" said th[] voic[]. "F[]tch m[] my glov[]s this mom[]nt!" Th[]n cam[] a littl[] patt[]ring of f[][]t on th[] stairs. Alic[] kn[]w it was th[] Rabbit coming to look for h[]r, and sh[] tr[]mbl[]d till sh[] shook th[] hous[], quit[] forg[]tting that sh[] was now about a thousand tim[]s as larg[] as th[] Rabbit, and had no r[]ason to b[] afraid of it.

Pr[]s[]ntly th[] Rabbit cam[] up to th[] door, and tri[]d to op[]n it; but, as th[] door op[]n[]d inwards, and Alic[]'s []lbow was pr[]ss[]d hard against it, that att[]mpt prov[]d a failur[]. Alic[] h[]ard it say to its[]lf "Th[]n I'll go round and g[]t in at th[] window."

"That you won't!" thought Alic[], and, aft[]r waiting till sh[] fanci[]d sh[] h[]ard th[] Rabbit just und[]r th[] window, sh[] sudd[]nly spr[]ad out h[]r hand, and mad[] a snatch in th[] air. Sh[] did not g[]t hold of anything, but sh[] h[]ard a littl[] shri[]k and a fall, and a crash of brok[]n glass, from which sh[] conclud[]d that it was just possibl[] it had fall[]n into a cucumb[]r-fram[], or som[]thing of th[] sort.

N[]xt cam[] an angry voic[] -- th[] Rabbit's -- "Pat! Pat! Wh[]r[] ar[] you?" And th[]n a voic[] sh[] had n[]v[]r h[]ard b[]for[], "Sur[] th[]n I'm h[]r[]! Digging for appl[]s, y[]r honour!"

"Digging for appl[]s, ind[][]d!" said th[] Rabbit angrily. "H[]r[]! Com[] and h[]lp m[] out of this!" (Sounds of mor[] brok[]n glass.)

"Now t[]ll m[], Pat, what's that in th[] window?"

"Sur[], it's an arm, y[]r honour!" (H[] pronounc[]d it "arrum.")

"An arm, you goos[]! Who []v[]r saw on[] that siz[]? Why, it fills th[] whol[] window!"

"Sur[], it do[]s, y[]r honour: but it's an arm for all that."

"W[]ll, it's got no busin[]ss th[]r[], at any rat[]: go and tak[] it away!"

Th[]r[] was a long sil[]nc[] aft[]r this, and Alic[] could only h[]ar whisp[]rs now and th[]n; such as, "Sur[], I don't lik[] it, y[]r honour, at all, at all!" "Do as I t[]ll you, you coward!" and at last sh[] spr[]ad out h[]r hand again, and mad[] anoth[]r snatch in th[] air. This tim[] th[]r[] w[]r[] two littl[] shri[]ks, and mor[] sounds of brok[]n glass. "What a numb[]r of cucumb[]r-fram[]s th[]r[] must b[]!" thought Alic[]. "I wond[]r what th[]y'll do n[]xt! As for pulling m[] out of th[] window, I only wish th[]y could! I'm sur[] I don't want to stay in h[]r[] any long[]r!"

Sh[] wait[]d for som[] tim[] without h[]aring anything mor[]: at last cam[] a rumbling of littl[] cartwh[][]ls, and th[] sound of a good many voic[]s all talking tog[]th[]r: sh[] mad[] out th[] words: "Wh[]r[]'s th[] oth[]r ladd[]r? -- Why, I hadn't to bring but on[]; Bill's got th[] oth[]r -- Bill! f[]tch it h[]r[], lad! -- H[]r[], put '[]m up at this corn[]r -- No, ti[] '[]m tog[]th[]r first -- th[]y don't r[]ach half high []nough y[]t -- Oh! th[]y'll do w[]ll []nough; don't b[] particular -- H[]r[], Bill! catch hold of this rop[] -- Will th[] roof b[]ar? -- Mind that loos[] slat[] -- Oh, it's coming down! H[]ads b[]low!" (a loud crash) -- "Now, who did that? -- It was Bill, I fancy -- Who's to go down th[] chimn[]y? -- Nay, I shan't! You do it! -- That I won't, th[]n! -- Bill's to go down -- H[]r[], Bill! th[] mast[]r says you'r[] to go down th[] chimn[]y!"

"Oh! So Bill's got to com[] down th[] chimn[]y, has h[]?" said Alic[] to h[]rs[]lf. "Shy, th[]y s[][]m to put []v[]rything upon Bill! I wouldn't b[] in Bill's plac[] for a good d[]al: this fir[]plac[] is narrow, to b[] sur[]; but I think I can kick a littl[]!"

Sh[] dr[]w h[]r foot as far down th[] chimn[]y as sh[] could, and wait[]d till sh[] h[]ard a littl[] animal (sh[] couldn't gu[]ss of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in th[] chimn[]y clos[] abov[] h[]r: th[]n, saying to h[]rs[]lf "This is Bill," sh[] gav[] on[] sharp kick, and wait[]d to s[][] what would happ[]n n[]xt.

Th[] first thing sh[] h[]ard was a g[]n[]ral chorus of "Th[]r[] go[]s Bill!" th[]n th[] Rabbit's voic[] along -- "Catch him, you by th[] h[]dg[]!" th[]n sil[]nc[], and th[]n anoth[]r confusion of voic[]s -- "Hold up his h[]ad -- Brandy now -- Don't chok[] him -- How was it, old f[]llow? What happ[]n[]d to you? T[]ll us all about it!"

Last cam[] a littl[] f[][]bl[], squ[]aking voic[], ("That's Bill," thought Alic[],) "W[]ll, I hardly know -- No mor[], thank y[]; I'm b[]tt[]r now -- but I'm a d[]al too flust[]r[]d to t[]ll you -- all I know is, som[]thing com[]s at m[] lik[] a Jack-in-th[]-box, and up I go[]s lik[] a sky-rock[]t!"

"So you did, old f[]llow!" said th[] oth[]rs.

"W[] must burn th[] hous[] down!" said th[] Rabbit's voic[]; and Alic[] call[]d out as loud as sh[] could, "If you do, I'll s[]t Dinah at you!"

Th[]r[] was a d[]ad sil[]nc[] instantly, and Alic[] thought to h[]rs[]lf, "I wond[]r what th[]y will do n[]xt! If th[]y had any s[]ns[], th[]y'd tak[] th[] roof off." Aft[]r a minut[] or two, th[]y b[]gan moving about again, and Alic[] h[]ard th[] Rabbit say, "A barrowful will do, to b[]gin with."

"A barrowful of what?" thought Alic[]; but sh[] had not long to doubt, for th[] n[]xt mom[]nt a show[]r of littl[] p[]bbl[]s cam[] rattling in at th[] window, and som[] of th[]m hit h[]r in th[] fac[]. "I'll put a stop to this," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf, and shout[]d out, "You'd b[]tt[]r not do that again!" which produc[]d anoth[]r d[]ad sil[]nc[].

Alic[] notic[]d with som[] surpris[] that th[] p[]bbl[]s w[]r[] all turning into littl[] cak[]s as th[]y lay on th[] floor, and a bright id[]a cam[] into h[]r h[]ad. "If I []at on[] of th[]s[] cak[]s," sh[] thought, "it's sur[] to mak[] som[] chang[] in my siz[]; and as it can't possibly mak[] m[] larg[]r, it must mak[] m[] small[]r, I suppos[]."

So sh[] swallow[]d on[] of th[] cak[]s, and was d[]light[]d to find that sh[] b[]gan shrinking dir[]ctly. As soon as sh[] was small []nough to g[]t through th[] door, sh[] ran out of th[] hous[], and found quit[] a crowd of littl[] animals and birds waiting outsid[]. Th[] poor littl[] Lizard, Bill, was in th[] middl[], b[]ing h[]ld up by two guin[]a-pigs, who w[]r[] giving it som[]thing out of a bottl[]. Th[]y all mad[] a rush at Alic[] th[] mom[]nt sh[] app[]ar[]d; but sh[] ran off as hard as sh[] could, and soon found h[]rs[]lf saf[] in a thick wood.

"Th[] first thing I'v[] got to do," said Alic[] to h[]rs[]lf, as sh[] wand[]r[]d about in th[] wood, "is to grow to my right siz[] again; and th[] s[]cond thing is to find my way into that lov[]ly gard[]n. I think that will b[] th[] b[]st plan."

It sound[]d an []xc[]ll[]nt plan, no doubt, and v[]ry n[]atly and simply arrang[]d; th[] only difficulty was, that sh[] had not th[] small[]st id[]a how to s[]t about it; and whil[] sh[] was p[][]ring about anxiously among th[] tr[][]s, a littl[] sharp bark just ov[]r h[]r h[]ad mad[] h[]r look up in a gr[]at hurry.

An []normous puppy was looking down at h[]r with larg[] round []y[]s, and f[][]bly str[]tching out on[] paw, trying to touch h[]r. "Poor littl[] thing!" said Alic[], in a coaxing ton[], and sh[] tri[]d hard to whistl[] to it; but sh[] was t[]rribly fright[]n[]d all th[] tim[] at th[] thought that it might b[] hungry, in which cas[] it would b[] v[]ry lik[]ly to []at h[]r up in spit[] of all h[]r coaxing.

Hardly knowing what sh[] did, sh[] pick[]d up a littl[] bit of stick, and h[]ld it out to th[] puppy; wh[]r[]upon th[] puppy jump[]d into th[] air off all its f[][]t at onc[], with a y[]lp of d[]light, and rush[]d at th[] stick, and mad[] b[]li[]v[] to worry it; th[]n Alic[] dodg[]d b[]hind a gr[]at thistl[], to k[][]p h[]rs[]lf from b[]ing run ov[]r; and th[] mom[]nt sh[] app[]ar[]d on th[] oth[]r sid[], th[] puppy mad[] anoth[]r rush at th[] stick, and tumbl[]d h[]ad ov[]r h[][]ls in its hurry to g[]t hold of it; th[]n Alic[], thinking it was v[]ry lik[] having a gam[] of play with a cart-hors[], and []xp[]cting []v[]ry mom[]nt to b[] trampl[]d und[]r its f[][]t, ran round th[] thistl[] again; th[]n th[] puppy b[]gan a s[]ri[]s of short charg[]s at th[] stick, running a v[]ry littl[] way forwards []ach tim[] and a long way back, and barking hoars[]ly all th[] whil[], till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongu[] hanging out of its mouth, and its gr[]at []y[]s half shut.

This s[][]m[]d to Alic[] a good opportunity for making h[]r []scap[]; so sh[] s[]t off at onc[], and ran till sh[] was quit[] tir[]d and out of br[]ath, and till th[] puppy's bark sound[]d quit[] faint in th[] distanc[].

"And y[]t what a d[]ar littl[] puppy it was!" said Alic[], as sh[] l[]ant against a butt[]rcup to r[]st h[]rs[]lf, and fann[]d h[]rs[]lf with on[] of th[] l[]av[]s: "I should hav[] lik[]d t[]aching it tricks v[]ry much, if -- if I'd only b[][]n th[] right siz[] to do it! Oh d[]ar! I'd n[]arly forgott[]n that I'v[] got to grow up again! L[]t m[] s[][] -- how is it to b[] manag[]d? I suppos[] I ought to []at or drink som[]thing or oth[]r; but th[] gr[]at qu[]stion is, what?"

Th[] gr[]at qu[]stion c[]rtainly was, what? Alic[] look[]d all round h[]r at th[] flow[]rs and th[] blad[]s of grass, but sh[] did not s[][] anything that look[]d lik[] th[] right thing to []at or drink und[]r th[] circumstanc[]s. Th[]r[] was a larg[] mushroom growing n[]ar h[]r, about th[] sam[] h[]ight as h[]rs[]lf; and wh[]n sh[] had look[]d und[]r it, and on both sid[]s of it, and b[]hind it, it occurr[]d to h[]r that sh[] might as w[]ll look and s[][] what was on th[] top of it.

Sh[] str[]tch[]d h[]rs[]lf up on tipto[], and p[][]p[]d ov[]r th[] []dg[] of th[] mushroom, and h[]r []y[]s imm[]diat[]ly m[]t thos[] of a larg[] cat[]rpillar, that was sitting on th[] top with its arms fold[]d, qui[]tly smoking a long hookah, and taking not th[] small[]st notic[] of h[]r or of anything []ls[].

CHAPTER V.
Advic[] from a Cat[]rpillar
Th[] Cat[]rpillar and Alic[] look[]d at []ach oth[]r for som[] tim[] in sil[]nc[]: at last th[] Cat[]rpillar took th[] hookah out of its mouth, and addr[]ss[]d h[]r in a languid, sl[][]py voic[].

"Who ar[] you?" said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

This was not an []ncouraging op[]ning for a conv[]rsation. Alic[] r[]pli[]d, rath[]r shyly, "I -- I hardly know, sir, just at pr[]s[]nt -- at l[]ast I know who I was wh[]n I got up this morning, but I think I must hav[] b[][]n chang[]d s[]v[]ral tim[]s sinc[] th[]n."

"What do you m[]an by that?" said th[] Cat[]rpillar st[]rnly. "Explain yours[]lf!"

"I can't []xplain mys[]lf, I'm afraid, sir," said Alic[], "b[]caus[] I'm not mys[]lf, you s[][]."

"I don't s[][]," said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

"I'm afraid I can't put it mor[] cl[]arly," Alic[] r[]pli[]d v[]ry polit[]ly, "for I can't und[]rstand it mys[]lf to b[]gin with; and b[]ing so many diff[]r[]nt siz[]s in a day is v[]ry confusing."

"It isn't," said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

"W[]ll, p[]rhaps you hav[]n't found it so y[]t," said Alic[]; "but wh[]n you hav[] to turn into a chrysalis -- you will som[] day, you know -- and th[]n aft[]r that into a butt[]rfly, I should think you'll f[][]l it a littl[] qu[][]r, won't you?"

"Not a bit," said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

"W[]ll, p[]rhaps your f[][]lings may b[] diff[]r[]nt," said Alic[]; "all I know is, it would f[][]l v[]ry qu[][]r to m[]."

"You!" said th[] Cat[]rpillar cont[]mptuously. "Who ar[] you?"

Which brought th[]m back again to th[] b[]ginning of th[] conv[]rsation. Alic[] f[]lt a littl[] irritat[]d at th[] Cat[]rpillar's making such v[]ry short r[]marks, and sh[] dr[]w h[]rs[]lf up and said, v[]ry grav[]ly, "I think, you ought to t[]ll m[] who you ar[], first."

"Why?" said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

H[]r[] was anoth[]r puzzling qu[]stion; and as Alic[] could not think of any good r[]ason, and as th[] Cat[]rpillar s[][]m[]d to b[] in a v[]ry unpl[]asant stat[] of mind, sh[] turn[]d away.

"Com[] back!" th[] Cat[]rpillar call[]d aft[]r h[]r. "I'v[] som[]thing important to say!"

This sound[]d promising, c[]rtainly: Alic[] turn[]d and cam[] back again.

"K[][]p your t[]mp[]r," said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

"Is that all?" said Alic[], swallowing down h[]r ang[]r as w[]ll as sh[] could.

"No," said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

Alic[] thought sh[] might as w[]ll wait, as sh[] had nothing []ls[] to do, and p[]rhaps aft[]r all it might t[]ll h[]r som[]thing worth h[]aring. For som[] minut[]s it puff[]d away without sp[]aking, but at last it unfold[]d its arms, took th[] hookah out of its mouth again, and said, "So you think you'r[] chang[]d, do you?"

"I'm afraid I am, sir," said Alic[]; "I can't r[]m[]mb[]r things as I us[]d -- and I don't k[][]p th[] sam[] siz[] for t[]n minut[]s tog[]th[]r!"

"Can't r[]m[]mb[]r what things?" said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

"W[]ll, I'v[] tri[]d to say "How doth th[] littl[] busy b[][]," but it all cam[] diff[]r[]nt!" Alic[] r[]pli[]d in a v[]ry m[]lancholy voic[].

"R[]p[]at, "You ar[] old, Fath[]r William,'" said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

Alic[] fold[]d h[]r hands, and b[]gan: -- 

"You ar[] old, Fath[]r William," th[] young man said,
    "And your hair has b[]com[] v[]ry whit[];
And y[]t you inc[]ssantly stand on your h[]ad -- 
    Do you think, at your ag[], it is right?"

"In my youth," Fath[]r William r[]pli[]d to his son,
    "I f[]ar[]d it might injur[] th[] brain;
But, now that I'm p[]rf[]ctly sur[] I hav[] non[],
    Why, I do it again and again."

"You ar[] old," said th[] youth, "as I m[]ntion[]d b[]for[],
    And hav[] grown most uncommonly fat;
Y[]t you turn[]d a back-som[]rsault in at th[] door -- 
    Pray, what is th[] r[]ason of that?"

"In my youth," said th[] sag[], as h[] shook his gr[]y locks,
    "I k[]pt all my limbs v[]ry suppl[]
By th[] us[] of this ointm[]nt -- on[] shilling th[] box -- 
    Allow m[] to s[]ll you a coupl[]?"

"You ar[] old," said th[] youth, "and your jaws ar[] too w[]ak
    For anything tough[]r than su[]t;
Y[]t you finish[]d th[] goos[], with th[] bon[]s and th[] b[]ak -- 
    Pray, how did you manag[] to do it?"

"In my youth," said his fath[]r, "I took to th[] law,
    And argu[]d []ach cas[] with my wif[];
And th[] muscular str[]ngth, which it gav[] to my jaw,
    Has last[]d th[] r[]st of my lif[]."

"You ar[] old," said th[] youth, "on[] would hardly suppos[]
    That your []y[] was as st[]ady as []v[]r;
Y[]t you balanc[]d an [][]l on th[] []nd of your nos[] -- 
    What mad[] you so awfully cl[]v[]r?"

"I hav[] answ[]r[]d thr[][] qu[]stions, and that is []nough,"
    Said his fath[]r; "don't giv[] yours[]lf airs!
Do you think I can list[]n all day to such stuff?
    B[] off, or I'll kick you down stairs!"

"That is not said right," said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

"Not quit[] right, I'm afraid," said Alic[], timidly; "som[] of th[] words hav[] got alt[]r[]d."

"It is wrong from b[]ginning to []nd," said th[] Cat[]rpillar d[]cid[]dly, and th[]r[] was sil[]nc[] for som[] minut[]s.

Th[] Cat[]rpillar was th[] first to sp[]ak.

"What siz[] do you want to b[]?" it ask[]d.

"Oh, I'm not particular as to siz[]," Alic[] hastily r[]pli[]d; "only on[] do[]sn't lik[] changing so oft[]n, you know."

"I don't know," said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

Alic[] said nothing: sh[] had n[]v[]r b[][]n so much contradict[]d in h[]r lif[] b[]for[], and sh[] f[]lt that sh[] was losing h[]r t[]mp[]r.

"Ar[] you cont[]nt now?" said th[] Cat[]rpillar.

"W[]ll, I should lik[] to b[] a littl[] larg[]r, sir, if you wouldn't mind," said Alic[]: "thr[][] inch[]s is such a wr[]tch[]d h[]ight to b[]."

"It is a v[]ry good h[]ight ind[][]d!" said th[] Cat[]rpillar angrily, r[]aring its[]lf upright as it spok[] (it was []xactly thr[][] inch[]s high).

"But I'm not us[]d to it!" pl[]ad[]d poor Alic[] in a pit[]ous ton[]. And sh[] thought of h[]rs[]lf, "I wish th[] cr[]atur[]s wouldn't b[] so []asily off[]nd[]d!"

"You'll g[]t us[]d to it in tim[]," said th[] Cat[]rpillar; and it put th[] hookah into its mouth and b[]gan smoking again.

This tim[] Alic[] wait[]d pati[]ntly until it chos[] to sp[]ak again. In a minut[] or two th[] Cat[]rpillar took th[] hookah out of its mouth and yawn[]d onc[] or twic[], and shook its[]lf. Th[]n it got down off th[] mushroom, and crawl[]d away in th[] grass, m[]r[]ly r[]marking as it w[]nt, "On[] sid[] will mak[] you grow tall[]r, and th[] oth[]r sid[] will mak[] you grow short[]r."

"On[] sid[] of what? Th[] oth[]r sid[] of what?" thought Alic[] to h[]rs[]lf.

"Of th[] mushroom," said th[] Cat[]rpillar, just as if sh[] had ask[]d it aloud; and in anoth[]r mom[]nt it was out of sight.

Alic[] r[]main[]d looking thoughtfully at th[] mushroom for a minut[], trying to mak[] out which w[]r[] th[] two sid[]s of it; and as it was p[]rf[]ctly round, sh[] found this a v[]ry difficult qu[]stion. How[]v[]r, at last sh[] str[]tch[]d h[]r arms round it as far as th[]y would go, and brok[] off a bit of th[] []dg[] with []ach hand.

"And now which is which?" sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf, and nibbl[]d a littl[] of th[] right-hand bit to try th[] []ff[]ct: th[] n[]xt mom[]nt sh[] f[]lt a viol[]nt blow und[]rn[]ath h[]r chin: it had struck h[]r foot!

Sh[] was a good d[]al fright[]n[]d by this v[]ry sudd[]n chang[], but sh[] f[]lt that th[]r[] was no tim[] to b[] lost, as sh[] was shrinking rapidly; so sh[] s[]t to work at onc[] to []at som[] of th[] oth[]r bit. H[]r chin was pr[]ss[]d so clos[]ly against h[]r foot, that th[]r[] was hardly room to op[]n h[]r mouth; but sh[] did it at last, and manag[]d to swallow a mors[]l of th[] l[]fthand bit.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *
"Com[], my h[]ad's fr[][] at last!" said Alic[] in a ton[] of d[]light, which chang[]d into alarm in anoth[]r mom[]nt, wh[]n sh[] found that h[]r should[]rs w[]r[] nowh[]r[] to b[] found: all sh[] could s[][], wh[]n sh[] look[]d down, was an imm[]ns[] l[]ngth of n[]ck, which s[][]m[]d to ris[] lik[] a stalk out of a s[]a of gr[][]n l[]av[]s that lay far b[]low h[]r.

"What can all that gr[][]n stuff b[]?" said Alic[]. "And wh[]r[] hav[] my should[]rs got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't s[][] you?" Sh[] was moving th[]m about as sh[] spok[], but no r[]sult s[][]m[]d to follow, []xc[]pt a littl[] shaking among th[] distant gr[][]n l[]av[]s.

As th[]r[] s[][]m[]d to b[] no chanc[] of g[]tting h[]r hands up to h[]r h[]ad, sh[] tri[]d to g[]t h[]r h[]ad down to th[]m, and was d[]light[]d to find that h[]r n[]ck would b[]nd about []asily in any dir[]ction, lik[] a s[]rp[]nt. Sh[] had just succ[][]d[]d in curving it down into a grac[]ful zigzag, and was going to div[] in among th[] l[]av[]s, which sh[] found to b[] nothing but th[] tops of th[] tr[][]s und[]r which sh[] had b[][]n wand[]ring, wh[]n a sharp hiss mad[] h[]r draw back in a hurry: a larg[] pig[]on had flown into h[]r fac[], and was b[]ating h[]r viol[]ntly with its wings.

"S[]rp[]nt!" scr[]am[]d th[] Pig[]on.

"I'm not a s[]rp[]nt!" said Alic[] indignantly. "L[]t m[] alon[]!"

"S[]rp[]nt, I say again!" r[]p[]at[]d th[] Pig[]on, but in a mor[] subdu[]d ton[], and add[]d with a kind of sob, "I'v[] tri[]d []v[]ry way, and nothing s[][]ms to suit th[]m!"

"I hav[]n't th[] l[]ast id[]a what you'r[] talking about," said Alic[].

"I'v[] tri[]d th[] roots of tr[][]s, and I'v[] tri[]d banks, and I'v[] tri[]d h[]dg[]s," th[] Pig[]on w[]nt on, without att[]nding to h[]r; "but thos[] s[]rp[]nts! Th[]r[]'s no pl[]asing th[]m!"

Alic[] was mor[] and mor[] puzzl[]d, but sh[] thought th[]r[] was no us[] in saying anything mor[] till th[] Pig[]on had finish[]d.

"As if it wasn't troubl[] []nough hatching th[] []ggs," said th[] Pig[]on; "but I must b[] on th[] look-out for s[]rp[]nts night and day! Why, I hav[]n't had a wink of sl[][]p th[]s[] thr[][] w[][]ks!"

"I'm v[]ry sorry you'v[] b[][]n annoy[]d," said Alic[], who was b[]ginning to s[][] its m[]aning.

"And just as I'd tak[]n th[] high[]st tr[][] in th[] wood," continu[]d th[] Pig[]on, raising its voic[] to a shri[]k, "and just as I was thinking I should b[] fr[][] of th[]m at last, th[]y must n[][]ds com[] wriggling down from th[] sky! Ugh, S[]rp[]nt!"

"But I'm not a s[]rp[]nt, I t[]ll you!" said Alic[]. "I'm a -- I'm a -- "

"W[]ll! What ar[] you?" said th[] Pig[]on. "I can s[][] you'r[] trying to inv[]nt som[]thing!"

"I -- I'm a littl[] girl," said Alic[], rath[]r doubtfully, as sh[] r[]m[]mb[]r[]d th[] numb[]r of chang[]s sh[] had gon[] through that day.

"A lik[]ly story ind[][]d!" said th[] Pig[]on in a ton[] of th[] d[][]p[]st cont[]mpt. "I'v[] s[][]n a good many littl[] girls in my tim[], but n[]v[]r on[] with such a n[]ck as that! No, no! You'r[] a s[]rp[]nt; and th[]r[]'s no us[] d[]nying it. I suppos[] you'll b[] t[]lling m[] n[]xt that you n[]v[]r tast[]d an []gg!"

"I hav[] tast[]d []ggs, c[]rtainly," said Alic[], who was a v[]ry truthful child; "but littl[] girls []at []ggs quit[] as much as s[]rp[]nts do, you know."

"I don't b[]li[]v[] it," said th[] Pig[]on; "but if th[]y do, why th[]n th[]y'r[] a kind of s[]rp[]nt, that's all I can say."

This was such a n[]w id[]a to Alic[], that sh[] was quit[] sil[]nt for a minut[] or two, which gav[] th[] Pig[]on th[] opportunity of adding, "You'r[] looking for []ggs, I know that w[]ll []nough; and what do[]s it matt[]r to m[] wh[]th[]r you'r[] a littl[] girl or a s[]rp[]nt?"

"It matt[]rs a good d[]al to m[]," said Alic[] hastily; "but I'm not looking for []ggs, as it happ[]ns; and if I was, I shouldn't want yours: I don't lik[] th[]m raw."

"W[]ll, b[] off, th[]n!" said th[] Pig[]on in a sulky ton[], as it s[]ttl[]d down again into its n[]st. Alic[] crouch[]d down among th[] tr[][]s as w[]ll as sh[] could, for h[]r n[]ck k[]pt g[]tting []ntangl[]d among th[] branch[]s, and []v[]ry now and th[]n sh[] had to stop and untwist it. Aft[]r a whil[] sh[] r[]m[]mb[]r[]d that sh[] still h[]ld th[] pi[]c[]s of mushroom in h[]r hands, and sh[] s[]t to work v[]ry car[]fully, nibbling first at on[] and th[]n at th[] oth[]r, and growing som[]tim[]s tall[]r and som[]tim[]s short[]r, until sh[] had succ[][]d[]d in bringing h[]rs[]lf down to h[]r usual h[]ight.

It was so long sinc[] sh[] had b[][]n anything n[]ar th[] right siz[], that it f[]lt quit[] strang[] at first; but sh[] got us[]d to it in a f[]w minut[]s, and b[]gan talking to h[]rs[]lf, as usual. "Com[], th[]r[]'s half my plan don[] now! How puzzling all th[]s[] chang[]s ar[]! I'm n[]v[]r sur[] what I'm going to b[], from on[] minut[] to anoth[]r! How[]v[]r, I'v[] got back to my right siz[]: th[] n[]xt thing is, to g[]t into that b[]autiful gard[]n -- how is that to b[] don[], I wond[]r?" As sh[] said this, sh[] cam[] sudd[]nly upon an op[]n plac[], with a littl[] hous[] in it about four f[][]t high. "Who[]v[]r liv[]s th[]r[]," thought Alic[], "it'll n[]v[]r do to com[] upon th[]m this siz[]: why, I should fright[]n th[]m out of th[]ir wits!" So sh[] b[]gan nibbling at th[] righthand bit again, and did not v[]ntur[] to go n[]ar th[] hous[] till sh[] had brought h[]rs[]lf down to nin[] inch[]s high.

CHAPTER VI.
Pig and P[]pp[]r
For a minut[] or two sh[] stood looking at th[] hous[], and wond[]ring what to do n[]xt, wh[]n sudd[]nly a footman in liv[]ry cam[] running out of th[] wood -- (sh[] consid[]r[]d him to b[] a footman b[]caus[] h[] was in liv[]ry: oth[]rwis[], judging by his fac[] only, sh[] would hav[] call[]d him a fish) -- and rapp[]d loudly at th[] door with his knuckl[]s. It was op[]n[]d by anoth[]r footman in liv[]ry, with a round fac[], and larg[] []y[]s lik[] a frog; and both footm[]n, Alic[] notic[]d, had powd[]r[]d hair that curl[]d all ov[]r th[]ir h[]ads. Sh[] f[]lt v[]ry curious to know what it was all about, and cr[]pt a littl[] way out of th[] wood to list[]n.

Th[] Fish-Footman b[]gan by producing from und[]r his arm a gr[]at l[]tt[]r, n[]arly as larg[] as hims[]lf, and this h[] hand[]d ov[]r to th[] oth[]r, saying, in a sol[]mn ton[], "For th[] Duch[]ss. An invitation from th[] Qu[][]n to play croqu[]t." Th[] Frog-Footman r[]p[]at[]d, in th[] sam[] sol[]mn ton[], only changing th[] ord[]r of th[] words a littl[], "From th[] Qu[][]n. An invitation for th[] Duch[]ss to play croqu[]t."

Th[]n th[]y both bow[]d low, and th[]ir curls got []ntangl[]d tog[]th[]r.

Alic[] laugh[]d so much at this, that sh[] had to run back into th[] wood for f[]ar of th[]ir h[]aring h[]r; and wh[]n sh[] n[]xt p[][]p[]d out th[] Fish-Footman was gon[], and th[] oth[]r was sitting on th[] ground n[]ar th[] door, staring stupidly up into th[] sky.

Alic[] w[]nt timidly up to th[] door, and knock[]d.

"Th[]r[]'s no sort of us[] in knocking," said th[] Footman, "and that for two r[]asons. First, b[]caus[] I'm on th[] sam[] sid[] of th[] door as you ar[]; s[]condly, b[]caus[] th[]y'r[] making such a nois[] insid[], no on[] could possibly h[]ar you." And c[]rtainly th[]r[] was a most []xtraordinary nois[] going on within -- a constant howling and sn[][]zing, and []v[]ry now and th[]n a gr[]at crash, as if a dish or k[]ttl[] had b[][]n brok[]n to pi[]c[]s.

"Pl[]as[], th[]n," said Alic[], "how am I to g[]t in?"

"Th[]r[] might b[] som[] s[]ns[] in your knocking," th[] Footman w[]nt on without att[]nding to h[]r, "if w[] had th[] door b[]tw[][]n us. For instanc[], if you w[]r[] insid[], you might knock, and I could l[]t you out, you know." H[] was looking up into th[] sky all th[] tim[] h[] was sp[]aking, and this Alic[] thought d[]cid[]dly uncivil. "But p[]rhaps h[] can't h[]lp it," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf; "his []y[]s ar[] so v[]ry n[]arly at th[] top of his h[]ad. But at any rat[] h[] might answ[]r qu[]stions. -- How am I to g[]t in?" sh[] r[]p[]at[]d, aloud.

"I shall sit h[]r[]," th[] Footman r[]mark[]d, "till tomorrow -- "

At this mom[]nt th[] door of th[] hous[] op[]n[]d, and a larg[] plat[] cam[] skimming out, straight at th[] Footman's h[]ad: it just graz[]d his nos[], and brok[] to pi[]c[]s against on[] of th[] tr[][]s b[]hind him.

" -- or n[]xt day, mayb[]," th[] Footman continu[]d in th[] sam[] ton[], []xactly as if nothing had happ[]n[]d.

"How am I to g[]t in?" ask[]d Alic[] again, in a loud[]r ton[].

"Ar[] you to g[]t in at all?" said th[] Footman. "That's th[] first qu[]stion, you know."

It was, no doubt: only Alic[] did not lik[] to b[] told so. "It's r[]ally dr[]adful," sh[] mutt[]r[]d to h[]rs[]lf, "th[] way all th[] cr[]atur[]s argu[]. It's []nough to driv[] on[] crazy!"

Th[] Footman s[][]m[]d to think this a good opportunity for r[]p[]ating his r[]mark, with variations. "I shall sit h[]r[]," h[] said, "on and off, for days and days."

"But what am I to do?" said Alic[].

"Anything you lik[]," said th[] Footman, and b[]gan whistling.

"Oh, th[]r[]'s no us[] in talking to him," said Alic[] d[]sp[]rat[]ly: "h[]'s p[]rf[]ctly idiotic!" And sh[] op[]n[]d th[] door and w[]nt in.

Th[] door l[]d right into a larg[] kitch[]n, which was full of smok[] from on[] []nd to th[] oth[]r: th[] Duch[]ss was sitting on a thr[][]-l[]gg[]d stool in th[] middl[], nursing a baby; th[] cook was l[]aning ov[]r th[] fir[], stirring a larg[] cauldron which s[][]m[]d to b[] full of soup.

"Th[]r[]'s c[]rtainly too much p[]pp[]r in that soup!" Alic[] said to h[]rs[]lf, as w[]ll as sh[] could for sn[][]zing.

Th[]r[] was c[]rtainly too much of it in th[] air. Ev[]n th[] Duch[]ss sn[][]z[]d occasionally; and as for th[] baby, it was sn[][]zing and howling alt[]rnat[]ly without a mom[]nt's paus[]. Th[] only things in th[] kitch[]n that did not sn[][]z[], w[]r[] th[] cook, and a larg[] cat which was sitting on th[] h[]arth and grinning from []ar to []ar.

"Pl[]as[] would you t[]ll m[]," said Alic[], a littl[] timidly, for sh[] was not quit[] sur[] wh[]th[]r it was good mann[]rs for h[]r to sp[]ak first, "why your cat grins lik[] that?"

"It's a Ch[]shir[] cat," said th[] Duch[]ss, "and that's why. Pig!"

Sh[] said th[] last word with such sudd[]n viol[]nc[] that Alic[] quit[] jump[]d; but sh[] saw in anoth[]r mom[]nt that it was addr[]ss[]d to th[] baby, and not to h[]r, so sh[] took courag[], and w[]nt on again: -- 

"I didn't know that Ch[]shir[] cats always grinn[]d; in fact, I didn't know that cats could grin."

"Th[]y all can," said th[] Duch[]ss; "and most of '[]m do."

"I don't know of any that do," Alic[] said v[]ry polit[]ly, f[][]ling quit[] pl[]as[]d to hav[] got into a conv[]rsation.

"You don't know much," said th[] Duch[]ss; "and that's a fact."

Alic[] did not at all lik[] th[] ton[] of this r[]mark, and thought it would b[] as w[]ll to introduc[] som[] oth[]r subj[]ct of conv[]rsation. Whil[] sh[] was trying to fix on on[], th[] cook took th[] cauldron of soup off th[] fir[], and at onc[] s[]t to work throwing []v[]rything within h[]r r[]ach at th[] Duch[]ss and th[] baby -- th[] fir[]-irons cam[] first; th[]n follow[]d a show[]r of sauc[]pans, plat[]s, and dish[]s. Th[] Duch[]ss took no notic[] of th[]m []v[]n wh[]n th[]y hit h[]r; and th[] baby was howling so much alr[]ady, that it was quit[] impossibl[] to say wh[]th[]r th[] blows hurt it or not.

"Oh, pl[]as[] mind what you'r[] doing!" cri[]d Alic[], jumping up and down in an agony of t[]rror. "Oh, th[]r[] go[]s his pr[]cious nos[]!" as an unusually larg[] sauc[]pan fl[]w clos[] by it, and v[]ry n[]arly carri[]d it off.

"If []v[]rybody mind[]d th[]ir own busin[]ss," th[] Duch[]ss said in a hoars[] growl, "th[] world would go round a d[]al fast[]r than it do[]s."

"Which would not b[] an advantag[]," said Alic[], who f[]lt v[]ry glad to g[]t an opportunity of showing off a littl[] of h[]r knowl[]dg[]. "Just think of what work it would mak[] with th[] day and night! You s[][] th[] []arth tak[]s tw[]nty-four hours to turn round on its axis -- "

"Talking of ax[]s," said th[] Duch[]ss, "chop off h[]r h[]ad!"

Alic[] glanc[]d rath[]r anxiously at th[] cook, to s[][] if sh[] m[]ant to tak[] th[] hint; but th[] cook was busily stirring th[] soup, and s[][]m[]d not to b[] list[]ning, so sh[] w[]nt on again: "Tw[]nty-four hours, I think; or is it tw[]lv[]? I -- "

"Oh, don't both[]r m[]," said th[] Duch[]ss; "I n[]v[]r could abid[] figur[]s!" And with that sh[] b[]gan nursing h[]r child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as sh[] did so, and giving it a viol[]nt shak[] at th[] []nd of []v[]ry lin[]:

"Sp[]ak roughly to your littl[] boy,
    And b[]at him wh[]n h[] sn[][]z[]s:
H[] only do[]s it to annoy,
    B[]caus[] h[] knows it t[]as[]s."

CHORUS.
(In which th[] cook and th[] baby join[]d):

"Wow! wow! wow!"

Whil[] th[] Duch[]ss sang th[] s[]cond v[]rs[] of th[] song, sh[] k[]pt tossing th[] baby viol[]ntly up and down, and th[] poor littl[] thing howl[]d so, that Alic[] could hardly h[]ar th[] words: -- 

"I sp[]ak s[]v[]r[]ly to my boy,
    I b[]at him wh[]n h[] sn[][]z[]s;
For h[] can thoroughly []njoy
    Th[] p[]pp[]r wh[]n h[] pl[]as[]s!"

CHORUS.

"Wow! wow! wow!"

"H[]r[]! you may nurs[] it a bit, if you lik[]!" th[] Duch[]ss said to Alic[], flinging th[] baby at h[]r as sh[] spok[]. "I must go and g[]t r[]ady to play croqu[]t with th[] Qu[][]n," and sh[] hurri[]d out of th[] room. Th[] cook thr[]w a frying-pan aft[]r h[]r as sh[] w[]nt out, but it just miss[]d h[]r.

Alic[] caught th[] baby with som[] difficulty, as it was a qu[][]r-shap[]d littl[] cr[]atur[], and h[]ld out its arms and l[]gs in all dir[]ctions, "just lik[] a star-fish," thought Alic[]. Th[] poor littl[] thing was snorting lik[] a st[]am-[]ngin[] wh[]n sh[] caught it, and k[]pt doubling its[]lf up and straight[]ning its[]lf out again, so that altog[]th[]r, for th[] first minut[] or two, it was as much as sh[] could do to hold it.

As soon as sh[] had mad[] out th[] prop[]r way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and th[]n k[][]p tight hold of its right []ar and l[]ft foot, so as to pr[]v[]nt its undoing its[]lf,) sh[] carri[]d it out into th[] op[]n air. "If I don't tak[] this child away with m[]," thought Alic[], "th[]y'r[] sur[] to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it b[] murd[]r to l[]av[] it b[]hind?" Sh[] said th[] last words out loud, and th[] littl[] thing grunt[]d in r[]ply (it had l[]ft off sn[][]zing by this tim[]). "Don't grunt," said Alic[]; "that's not at all a prop[]r way of []xpr[]ssing yours[]lf."

Th[] baby grunt[]d again, and Alic[] look[]d v[]ry anxiously into its fac[] to s[][] what was th[] matt[]r with it. Th[]r[] could b[] no doubt that it had a v[]ry turn-up nos[], much mor[] lik[] a snout than a r[]al nos[]; also its []y[]s w[]r[] g[]tting []xtr[]m[]ly small for a baby: altog[]th[]r Alic[] did not lik[] th[] look of th[] thing at all. "But p[]rhaps it was only sobbing," sh[] thought, and look[]d into its []y[]s again, to s[][] if th[]r[] w[]r[] any t[]ars.

No, th[]r[] w[]r[] no t[]ars. "If you'r[] going to turn into a pig, my d[]ar," said Alic[], s[]riously, "I'll hav[] nothing mor[] to do with you. Mind now!" Th[] poor littl[] thing sobb[]d again (or grunt[]d, it was impossibl[] to say which), and th[]y w[]nt on for som[] whil[] in sil[]nc[].

Alic[] was just b[]ginning to think to h[]rs[]lf, "Now, what am I to do with this cr[]atur[] wh[]n I g[]t it hom[]?" wh[]n it grunt[]d again, so viol[]ntly, that sh[] look[]d down into its fac[] in som[] alarm. This tim[] th[]r[] could b[] no mistak[] about it: it was n[]ith[]r mor[] nor l[]ss than a pig, and sh[] f[]lt that it would b[] quit[] absurd for h[]r to carry it furth[]r.

So sh[] s[]t th[] littl[] cr[]atur[] down, and f[]lt quit[] r[]li[]v[]d to s[][] it trot away qui[]tly into th[] wood. "If it had grown up," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf, "it would hav[] mad[] a dr[]adfully ugly child: but it mak[]s rath[]r a handsom[] pig, I think." And sh[] b[]gan thinking ov[]r oth[]r childr[]n sh[] kn[]w, who might do v[]ry w[]ll as pigs, and was just saying to h[]rs[]lf, "if on[] only kn[]w th[] right way to chang[] th[]m -- " wh[]n sh[] was a littl[] startl[]d by s[][]ing th[] Ch[]shir[] Cat sitting on a bough of a tr[][] a f[]w yards off.

Th[] Cat only grinn[]d wh[]n it saw Alic[]. It look[]d good-natur[]d, sh[] thought: still it had v[]ry long claws and a gr[]at many t[][]th, so sh[] f[]lt that it ought to b[] tr[]at[]d with r[]sp[]ct.

"Ch[]shir[] Puss," sh[] b[]gan, rath[]r timidly, as sh[] did not at all know wh[]th[]r it would lik[] th[] nam[]: how[]v[]r, it only grinn[]d a littl[] wid[]r. "Com[], it's pl[]as[]d so far," thought Alic[], and sh[] w[]nt on. "Would you t[]ll m[], pl[]as[], which way I ought to go from h[]r[]?"

"That d[]p[]nds a good d[]al on wh[]r[] you want to g[]t to," said th[] Cat.

"I don't much car[] wh[]r[] -- " said Alic[].

"Th[]n it do[]sn't matt[]r which way you go," said th[] Cat.

" -- so long as I g[]t som[]wh[]r[]," Alic[] add[]d as an []xplanation.

"Oh, you'r[] sur[] to do that," said th[] Cat, "if you only walk long []nough."

Alic[] f[]lt that this could not b[] d[]ni[]d, so sh[] tri[]d anoth[]r qu[]stion. "What sort of p[]opl[] liv[] about h[]r[]?"

"In that dir[]ction," th[] Cat said, waving its right paw round, "liv[]s a Hatt[]r: and in that dir[]ction," waving th[] oth[]r paw, "liv[]s a March Har[]. Visit []ith[]r you lik[]: th[]y'r[] both mad."

"But I don't want to go among mad p[]opl[]," Alic[] r[]mark[]d.

"Oh, you can't h[]lp that," said th[] Cat: "w[]'r[] all mad h[]r[]. I'm mad. You'r[] mad."

"How do you know I'm mad?" said Alic[].

"You must b[]," said th[] Cat, "or you wouldn't hav[] com[] h[]r[]."

Alic[] didn't think that prov[]d it at all; how[]v[]r, sh[] w[]nt on "And how do you know that you'r[] mad?"

"To b[]gin with," said th[] Cat, "a dog's not mad. You grant that?"

"I suppos[] so," said Alic[].

"W[]ll, th[]n," th[] Cat w[]nt on, "you s[][], a dog growls wh[]n it's angry, and wags its tail wh[]n it's pl[]as[]d. Now I growl wh[]n I'm pl[]as[]d, and wag my tail wh[]n I'm angry. Th[]r[]for[] I'm mad."

"I call it purring, not growling," said Alic[].

"Call it what you lik[]," said th[] Cat. "Do you play croqu[]t with th[] Qu[][]n to-day?"

"I should lik[] it v[]ry much," said Alic[], "but I hav[]n't b[][]n invit[]d y[]t."

"You'll s[][] m[] th[]r[]," said th[] Cat, and vanish[]d.

Alic[] was not much surpris[]d at this, sh[] was g[]tting so us[]d to qu[][]r things happ[]ning. Whil[] sh[] was looking at th[] plac[] wh[]r[] it had b[][]n, it sudd[]nly app[]ar[]d again.

"By-th[]-by[], what b[]cam[] of th[] baby?" said th[] Cat. "I'd n[]arly forgott[]n to ask."

"It turn[]d into a pig," Alic[] qui[]tly said, just as if it had com[] back in a natural way.

"I thought it would," said th[] Cat, and vanish[]d again.

Alic[] wait[]d a littl[], half []xp[]cting to s[][] it again, but it did not app[]ar, and aft[]r a minut[] or two sh[] walk[]d on in th[] dir[]ction in which th[] March Har[] was said to liv[]. "I'v[] s[][]n hatt[]rs b[]for[]," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf; "th[] March Har[] will b[] much th[] most int[]r[]sting, and p[]rhaps as this is May it won't b[] raving mad -- at l[]ast not so mad as it was in March." As sh[] said this, sh[] look[]d up, and th[]r[] was th[] Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tr[][].

"Did you say pig, or fig?" said th[] Cat.

"I said pig," r[]pli[]d Alic[]; "and I wish you wouldn't k[][]p app[]aring and vanishing so sudd[]nly: you mak[] on[] quit[] giddy."

"All right," said th[] Cat; and this tim[] it vanish[]d quit[] slowly, b[]ginning with th[] []nd of th[] tail, and []nding with th[] grin, which r[]main[]d som[] tim[] aft[]r th[] r[]st of it had gon[].

"W[]ll! I'v[] oft[]n s[][]n a cat without a grin," thought Alic[]; "but a grin without a cat! It's th[] most curious thing I []v[]r saw in my lif[]!"

Sh[] had not gon[] much farth[]r b[]for[] sh[] cam[] in sight of th[] hous[] of th[] March Har[]: sh[] thought it must b[] th[] right hous[], b[]caus[] th[] chimn[]ys w[]r[] shap[]d lik[] []ars and th[] roof was thatch[]d with fur. It was so larg[] a hous[], that sh[] did not lik[] to go n[]ar[]r till sh[] had nibbl[]d som[] mor[] of th[] l[]fthand bit of mushroom, and rais[]d h[]rs[]lf to about two f[][]t high: []v[]n th[]n sh[] walk[]d up towards it rath[]r timidly, saying to h[]rs[]lf "Suppos[] it should b[] raving mad aft[]r all! I almost wish I'd gon[] to s[][] th[] Hatt[]r inst[]ad!"

CHAPTER VII.
A Mad T[]a-Party
Th[]r[] was a tabl[] s[]t out und[]r a tr[][] in front of th[] hous[], and th[] March Har[] and th[] Hatt[]r w[]r[] having t[]a at it: a Dormous[] was sitting b[]tw[][]n th[]m, fast asl[][]p, and th[] oth[]r two w[]r[] using it as a cushion, r[]sting th[]ir []lbows on it, and talking ov[]r its h[]ad. "V[]ry uncomfortabl[] for th[] Dormous[]," thought Alic[]; "only, as it's asl[][]p, I suppos[] it do[]sn't mind."

Th[] tabl[] was a larg[] on[], but th[] thr[][] w[]r[] all crowd[]d tog[]th[]r at on[] corn[]r of it: "No room! No room!" th[]y cri[]d out wh[]n th[]y saw Alic[] coming. "Th[]r[]'s pl[]nty of room!" said Alic[] indignantly, and sh[] sat down in a larg[] arm-chair at on[] []nd of th[] tabl[].

"Hav[] som[] win[]," th[] March Har[] said in an []ncouraging ton[].

Alic[] look[]d all round th[] tabl[], but th[]r[] was nothing on it but t[]a. "I don't s[][] any win[]," sh[] r[]mark[]d.

"Th[]r[] isn't any," said th[] March Har[].

"Th[]n it wasn't v[]ry civil of you to off[]r it," said Alic[] angrily.

"It wasn't v[]ry civil of you to sit down without b[]ing invit[]d," said th[] March Har[].

"I didn't know it was your tabl[]," said Alic[]; "it's laid for a gr[]at many mor[] than thr[][]."

"Your hair wants cutting," said th[] Hatt[]r. H[] had b[][]n looking at Alic[] for som[] tim[] with gr[]at curiosity, and this was his first sp[][]ch.

"You should l[]arn not to mak[] p[]rsonal r[]marks," Alic[] said with som[] s[]v[]rity; "it's v[]ry rud[]."

Th[] Hatt[]r op[]n[]d his []y[]s v[]ry wid[] on h[]aring this; but all h[] said was, "Why is a rav[]n lik[] a writing-d[]sk?"

"Com[], w[] shall hav[] som[] fun now!" thought Alic[]. "I'm glad th[]y'v[] b[]gun asking riddl[]s. -- I b[]li[]v[] I can gu[]ss that," sh[] add[]d aloud.

"Do you m[]an that you think you can find out th[] answ[]r to it?" said th[] March Har[].

"Exactly so," said Alic[].

"Th[]n you should say what you m[]an," th[] March Har[] w[]nt on.

"I do," Alic[] hastily r[]pli[]d; "at l[]ast -- at l[]ast I m[]an what I say -- that's th[] sam[] thing, you know."

"Not th[] sam[] thing a bit!" said th[] Hatt[]r. "You might just as w[]ll say that 'I s[][] what I []at' is th[] sam[] thing as 'I []at what I s[][]'!"

"You might just as w[]ll say," add[]d th[] March Har[], "that 'I lik[] what I g[]t' is th[] sam[] thing as 'I g[]t what I lik[]'!"

"You might just as w[]ll say," add[]d th[] Dormous[], who s[][]m[]d to b[] talking in his sl[][]p, "that 'I br[]ath[] wh[]n I sl[][]p' is th[] sam[] thing as 'I sl[][]p wh[]n I br[]ath[]'!"

"It is th[] sam[] thing with you," said th[] Hatt[]r, and h[]r[] th[] conv[]rsation dropp[]d, and th[] party sat sil[]nt for a minut[], whil[] Alic[] thought ov[]r all sh[] could r[]m[]mb[]r about rav[]ns and writing-d[]sks, which wasn't much.

Th[] Hatt[]r was th[] first to br[]ak th[] sil[]nc[]. "What day of th[] month is it?" h[] said, turning to Alic[]: h[] had tak[]n his watch out of his pock[]t, and was looking at it un[]asily, shaking it []v[]ry now and th[]n, and holding it to his []ar.

Alic[] consid[]r[]d a littl[], and th[]n said "Th[] fourth."

"Two days wrong!" sigh[]d th[] Hatt[]r. "I told you butt[]r wouldn't suit th[] works!" h[] add[]d looking angrily at th[] March Har[].

"It was th[] b[]st butt[]r," th[] March Har[] m[][]kly r[]pli[]d.

"Y[]s, but som[] crumbs must hav[] got in as w[]ll," th[] Hatt[]r grumbl[]d: "you shouldn't hav[] put it in with th[] br[]ad-knif[]."

Th[] March Har[] took th[] watch and look[]d at it gloomily: th[]n h[] dipp[]d it into his cup of t[]a, and look[]d at it again: but h[] could think of nothing b[]tt[]r to say than his first r[]mark, "It was th[] b[]st butt[]r, you know."

Alic[] had b[][]n looking ov[]r his should[]r with som[] curiosity. "What a funny watch!" sh[] r[]mark[]d. "It t[]lls th[] day of th[] month, and do[]sn't t[]ll what o'clock it is!"

"Why should it?" mutt[]r[]d th[] Hatt[]r. "Do[]s your watch t[]ll you what y[]ar it is?"

"Of cours[] not," Alic[] r[]pli[]d v[]ry r[]adily: "but that's b[]caus[] it stays th[] sam[] y[]ar for such a long tim[] tog[]th[]r."

"Which is just th[] cas[] with min[]," said th[] Hatt[]r.

Alic[] f[]lt dr[]adfully puzzl[]d. Th[] Hatt[]r's r[]mark s[][]m[]d to hav[] no sort of m[]aning in it, and y[]t it was c[]rtainly English. "I don't quit[] und[]rstand you," sh[] said, as polit[]ly as sh[] could.

"Th[] Dormous[] is asl[][]p again," said th[] Hatt[]r, and h[] pour[]d a littl[] hot t[]a upon its nos[].

Th[] Dormous[] shook its h[]ad impati[]ntly, and said, without op[]ning its []y[]s, "Of cours[], of cours[]; just what I was going to r[]mark mys[]lf."

"Hav[] you gu[]ss[]d th[] riddl[] y[]t?" th[] Hatt[]r said, turning to Alic[] again.

"No, I giv[] it up," Alic[] r[]pli[]d: "what's th[] answ[]r?"

"I hav[]n't th[] slight[]st id[]a," said th[] Hatt[]r.

"Nor I," said th[] March Har[].

Alic[] sigh[]d w[]arily. "I think you might do som[]thing b[]tt[]r with th[] tim[]," sh[] said, "than wast[] it in asking riddl[]s that hav[] no answ[]rs."

"If you kn[]w Tim[] as w[]ll as I do," said th[] Hatt[]r, "you wouldn't talk about wasting it. It's him."

"I don't know what you m[]an," said Alic[].

"Of cours[] you don't!" th[] Hatt[]r said, tossing his h[]ad cont[]mptuously. "I dar[] say you n[]v[]r []v[]n spok[] to Tim[]!"

"P[]rhaps not," Alic[] cautiously r[]pli[]d: "but I know I hav[] to b[]at tim[] wh[]n I l[]arn music."

"Ah! that accounts for it," said th[] Hatt[]r. "H[] won't stand b[]ating. Now, if you only k[]pt on good t[]rms with him, h[]'d do almost anything you lik[]d with th[] clock. For instanc[], suppos[] it w[]r[] nin[] o'clock in th[] morning, just tim[] to b[]gin l[]ssons: you'd only hav[] to whisp[]r a hint to Tim[], and round go[]s th[] clock in a twinkling! Half-past on[], tim[] for dinn[]r!"

("I only wish it was," th[] March Har[] said to its[]lf in a whisp[]r.)

"That would b[] grand, c[]rtainly," said Alic[] thoughtfully: "but th[]n -- I shouldn't b[] hungry for it, you know."

"Not at first, p[]rhaps," said th[] Hatt[]r: "but you could k[][]p it to half-past on[] as long as you lik[]d."

"Is that th[] way you manag[]?" Alic[] ask[]d.

Th[] Hatt[]r shook his h[]ad mournfully. "Not I!" h[] r[]pli[]d. "W[] quarr[]ll[]d last March -- just b[]for[] h[] w[]nt mad, you know -- " (pointing with his t[]a spoon at th[] March Har[],) " -- it was at th[] gr[]at conc[]rt giv[]n by th[] Qu[][]n of H[]arts, and I had to sing

'Twinkl[], twinkl[], littl[] bat!
How I wond[]r what you'r[] at!'

You know th[] song, p[]rhaps?"

"I'v[] h[]ard som[]thing lik[] it," said Alic[].

"It go[]s on, you know," th[] Hatt[]r continu[]d, "in this way: -- 

'Up abov[] th[] world you fly,
Lik[] a t[]a-tray in th[] sky.
                    Twinkl[], twinkl[] -- '"

H[]r[] th[] Dormous[] shook its[]lf, and b[]gan singing in its sl[][]p "Twinkl[], twinkl[], twinkl[], twinkl[] -- " and w[]nt on so long that th[]y had to pinch it to mak[] it stop.

"W[]ll, I'd hardly finish[]d th[] first v[]rs[]," said th[] Hatt[]r, "wh[]n th[] Qu[][]n jump[]d up and bawl[]d out, 'H[]'s murd[]ring th[] tim[]! Off with his h[]ad!'"

"How dr[]adfully savag[]!" []xclaim[]d Alic[].

"And []v[]r sinc[] that," th[] Hatt[]r w[]nt on in a mournful ton[], "h[] won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now."

A bright id[]a cam[] into Alic[]'s h[]ad. "Is that th[] r[]ason so many t[]a-things ar[] put out h[]r[]?" sh[] ask[]d.

"Y[]s, that's it," said th[] Hatt[]r with a sigh: "it's always t[]a-tim[], and w[]'v[] no tim[] to wash th[] things b[]tw[][]n whil[]s."

"Th[]n you k[][]p moving round, I suppos[]?" said Alic[].

"Exactly so," said th[] Hatt[]r: "as th[] things g[]t us[]d up."

"But what happ[]ns wh[]n you com[] to th[] b[]ginning again?" Alic[] v[]ntur[]d to ask.

"Suppos[] w[] chang[] th[] subj[]ct," th[] March Har[] int[]rrupt[]d, yawning. "I'm g[]tting tir[]d of this. I vot[] th[] young lady t[]lls us a story."

"I'm afraid I don't know on[]," said Alic[], rath[]r alarm[]d at th[] proposal.

"Th[]n th[] Dormous[] shall!" th[]y both cri[]d. "Wak[] up, Dormous[]!" And th[]y pinch[]d it on both sid[]s at onc[].

Th[] Dormous[] slowly op[]n[]d his []y[]s. "I wasn't asl[][]p," h[] said in a hoars[], f[][]bl[] voic[]: "I h[]ard []v[]ry word you f[]llows w[]r[] saying."

"T[]ll us a story!" said th[] March Har[].

"Y[]s, pl[]as[] do!" pl[]ad[]d Alic[].

"And b[] quick about it," add[]d th[] Hatt[]r, "or you'll b[] asl[][]p again b[]for[] it's don[]."

"Onc[] upon a tim[] th[]r[] w[]r[] thr[][] littl[] sist[]rs," th[] Dormous[] b[]gan in a gr[]at hurry; "and th[]ir nam[]s w[]r[] Elsi[], Laci[], and Tilli[]; and th[]y liv[]d at th[] bottom of a w[]ll -- "

"What did th[]y liv[] on?" said Alic[], who always took a gr[]at int[]r[]st in qu[]stions of []ating and drinking.

"Th[]y liv[]d on tr[]acl[]," said th[] Dormous[], aft[]r thinking a minut[] or two.

"Th[]y couldn't hav[] don[] that, you know," Alic[] g[]ntly r[]mark[]d; "th[]y'd hav[] b[][]n ill."

"So th[]y w[]r[]," said th[] Dormous[]; "v[]ry ill."

Alic[] tri[]d to fancy to h[]rs[]lf what such an []xtraordinary ways of living would b[] lik[], but it puzzl[]d h[]r too much, so sh[] w[]nt on: "But why did th[]y liv[] at th[] bottom of a w[]ll?"

"Tak[] som[] mor[] t[]a," th[] March Har[] said to Alic[], v[]ry []arn[]stly.

"I'v[] had nothing y[]t," Alic[] r[]pli[]d in an off[]nd[]d ton[], "so I can't tak[] mor[]."

"You m[]an you can't tak[] l[]ss," said th[] Hatt[]r: "it's v[]ry []asy to tak[] mor[] than nothing."

"Nobody ask[]d your opinion," said Alic[].

"Who's making p[]rsonal r[]marks now?" th[] Hatt[]r ask[]d triumphantly.

Alic[] did not quit[] know what to say to this: so sh[] h[]lp[]d h[]rs[]lf to som[] t[]a and br[]ad-and-butt[]r, and th[]n turn[]d to th[] Dormous[], and r[]p[]at[]d h[]r qu[]stion. "Why did th[]y liv[] at th[] bottom of a w[]ll?"

Th[] Dormous[] again took a minut[] or two to think about it, and th[]n said, "It was a tr[]acl[]-w[]ll."

"Th[]r[]'s no such thing!" Alic[] was b[]ginning v[]ry angrily, but th[] Hatt[]r and th[] March Har[] w[]nt "Sh! sh!" and th[] Dormous[] sulkily r[]mark[]d, "If you can't b[] civil, you'd b[]tt[]r finish th[] story for yours[]lf."

"No, pl[]as[] go on!" Alic[] said v[]ry humbly; "I won't int[]rrupt again. I dar[] say th[]r[] may b[] on[]."

"On[], ind[][]d!" said th[] Dormous[] indignantly. How[]v[]r, h[] cons[]nt[]d to go on. "And so th[]s[] thr[][] littl[] sist[]rs -- th[]y w[]r[] l[]arning to draw, you know -- "

"What did th[]y draw?" said Alic[], quit[] forg[]tting h[]r promis[].

"Tr[]acl[]," said th[] Dormous[], without consid[]ring at all this tim[].

"I want a cl[]an cup," int[]rrupt[]d th[] Hatt[]r: "l[]t's all mov[] on[] plac[] on."

H[] mov[]d on as h[] spok[], and th[] Dormous[] follow[]d him: th[] March Har[] mov[]d into th[] Dormous[]'s plac[], and Alic[] rath[]r unwillingly took th[] plac[] of th[] March Har[]. Th[] Hatt[]r was th[] only on[] who got any advantag[] from th[] chang[]: and Alic[] was a good d[]al wors[] off than b[]for[], as th[] March Har[] had just ups[]t th[] milk-jug into his plat[].

Alic[] did not wish to off[]nd th[] Dormous[] again, so sh[] b[]gan v[]ry cautiously: "But I don't und[]rstand. Wh[]r[] did th[]y draw th[] tr[]acl[] from?"

"You can draw wat[]r out of a wat[]r-w[]ll," said th[] Hatt[]r; "so I should think you could draw tr[]acl[] out of a tr[]acl[]-w[]ll -- []h, stupid?"

"But th[]y w[]r[] in th[] w[]ll," Alic[] said to th[] Dormous[], not choosing to notic[] this last r[]mark.

"Of cours[] th[]y w[]r[]," said th[] Dormous[]; " -- w[]ll in."

This answ[]r so confus[]d poor Alic[], that sh[] l[]t th[] Dormous[] go on for som[] tim[] without int[]rrupting it.

"Th[]y w[]r[] l[]arning to draw," th[] Dormous[] w[]nt on, yawning and rubbing its []y[]s, for it was g[]tting v[]ry sl[][]py; "and th[]y dr[]w all mann[]r of things -- []v[]rything that b[]gins with an M -- "

"Why with an M?" said Alic[].

"Why not?" said th[] March Har[].

Alic[] was sil[]nt.

Th[] Dormous[] had clos[]d its []y[]s by this tim[], and was going off into a doz[]; but, on b[]ing pinch[]d by th[] Hatt[]r, it wok[] up again with a littl[] shri[]k, and w[]nt on: " -- that b[]gins with an M, such as mous[]-traps, and th[] moon, and m[]mory, and muchn[]ss -- you know you say things ar[] "much of a muchn[]ss" -- did you []v[]r s[][] such a thing as a drawing of a muchn[]ss?"

"R[]ally, now you ask m[]," said Alic[], v[]ry much confus[]d, "I don't think -- "

"Th[]n you shouldn't talk," said th[] Hatt[]r.

This pi[]c[] of rud[]n[]ss was mor[] than Alic[] could b[]ar: sh[] got up in gr[]at disgust, and walk[]d off; th[] Dormous[] f[]ll asl[][]p instantly, and n[]ith[]r of th[] oth[]rs took th[] l[]ast notic[] of h[]r going, though sh[] look[]d back onc[] or twic[], half hoping that th[]y would call aft[]r h[]r: th[] last tim[] sh[] saw th[]m, th[]y w[]r[] trying to put th[] Dormous[] into th[] t[]apot.

"At any rat[] I'll n[]v[]r go th[]r[] again!" said Alic[] as sh[] pick[]d h[]r way through th[] wood. "It's th[] stupid[]st t[]a-party I []v[]r was at in all my lif[]!"

Just as sh[] said this, sh[] notic[]d that on[] of th[] tr[][]s had a door l[]ading right into it. "That's v[]ry curious!" sh[] thought. "But []v[]rything's curious today. I think I may as w[]ll go in at onc[]." And in sh[] w[]nt.

Onc[] mor[] sh[] found h[]rs[]lf in th[] long hall, and clos[] to th[] littl[] glass tabl[]. "Now, I'll manag[] b[]tt[]r this tim[]," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf, and b[]gan by taking th[] littl[] gold[]n k[]y, and unlocking th[] door that l[]d into th[] gard[]n. Th[]n sh[] w[]nt to work nibbling at th[] mushroom (sh[] had k[]pt a pi[]c[] of it in h[]r pock[]t) till sh[] was about a foot high: th[]n sh[] walk[]d down th[] littl[] passag[]: and th[]n -- sh[] found h[]rs[]lf at last in th[] b[]autiful gard[]n, among th[] bright flow[]r-b[]ds and th[] cool fountains.

CHAPTER VIII.
Th[] Qu[][]n's Croqu[]t-Ground
A larg[] ros[]-tr[][] stood n[]ar th[] []ntranc[] of th[] gard[]n: th[] ros[]s growing on it w[]r[] whit[], but th[]r[] w[]r[] thr[][] gard[]n[]rs at it, busily painting th[]m r[]d. Alic[] thought this a v[]ry curious thing, and sh[] w[]nt n[]ar[]r to watch th[]m, and just as sh[] cam[] up to th[]m sh[] h[]ard on[] of th[]m say, "Look out now, Fiv[]! Don't go splashing paint ov[]r m[] lik[] that!"

"I couldn't h[]lp it," said Fiv[], in a sulky ton[]; "S[]v[]n jogg[]d my []lbow."

On which S[]v[]n look[]d up and said, "That's right, Fiv[]! Always lay th[] blam[] on oth[]rs!"

"You'd b[]tt[]r not talk!" said Fiv[]. "I h[]ard th[] Qu[][]n say only y[]st[]rday you d[]s[]rv[]d to b[] b[]h[]ad[]d!"

"What for?" said th[] on[] who had spok[]n first.

"That's non[] of your busin[]ss, Two!" said S[]v[]n.

"Y[]s, it is his busin[]ss!" said Fiv[], "and I'll t[]ll him -- it was for bringing th[] cook tulip-roots inst[]ad of onions."

S[]v[]n flung down his brush, and had just b[]gun "W[]ll, of all th[] unjust things -- " wh[]n his []y[] chanc[]d to fall upon Alic[], as sh[] stood watching th[]m, and h[] ch[]ck[]d hims[]lf sudd[]nly: th[] oth[]rs look[]d round also, and all of th[]m bow[]d low.

"Would you t[]ll m[]," said Alic[], a littl[] timidly, "why you ar[] painting thos[] ros[]s?"

Fiv[] and S[]v[]n said nothing, but look[]d at Two. Two b[]gan in a low voic[], "Why th[] fact is, you s[][], Miss, this h[]r[] ought to hav[] b[][]n a r[]d ros[]-tr[][], and w[] put a whit[] on[] in by mistak[]; and if th[] Qu[][]n was to find it out, w[] should all hav[] our h[]ads cut off, you know. So you s[][], Miss, w[]'r[] doing our b[]st, afor[] sh[] com[]s, to -- " At this mom[]nt Fiv[], who had b[][]n anxiously looking across th[] gard[]n, call[]d out "Th[] Qu[][]n! Th[] Qu[][]n!" and th[] thr[][] gard[]n[]rs instantly thr[]w th[]ms[]lv[]s flat upon th[]ir fac[]s. Th[]r[] was a sound of many footst[]ps, and Alic[] look[]d round, []ag[]r to s[][] th[] Qu[][]n.

First cam[] t[]n soldi[]rs carrying clubs; th[]s[] w[]r[] all shap[]d lik[] th[] thr[][] gard[]n[]rs, oblong and flat, with th[]ir hands and f[][]t at th[] corn[]rs: n[]xt th[] t[]n courti[]rs; th[]s[] w[]r[] ornam[]nt[]d all ov[]r with diamonds, and walk[]d two and two, as th[] soldi[]rs did. Aft[]r th[]s[] cam[] th[] royal childr[]n; th[]r[] w[]r[] t[]n of th[]m, and th[] littl[] d[]ars cam[] jumping m[]rrily along hand in hand, in coupl[]s: th[]y w[]r[] all ornam[]nt[]d with h[]arts. N[]xt cam[] th[] gu[]sts, mostly Kings and Qu[][]ns, and among th[]m Alic[] r[]cognis[]d th[] Whit[] Rabbit: it was talking in a hurri[]d n[]rvous mann[]r, smiling at []v[]rything that was said, and w[]nt by without noticing h[]r. Th[]n follow[]d th[] Knav[] of H[]arts, carrying th[] King's crown on a crimson v[]lv[]t cushion; and, last of all this grand proc[]ssion, cam[] THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

Alic[] was rath[]r doubtful wh[]th[]r sh[] ought not to li[] down on h[]r fac[] lik[] th[] thr[][] gard[]n[]rs, but sh[] could not r[]m[]mb[]r []v[]r having h[]ard of such a rul[] at proc[]ssions; "and b[]sid[]s, what would b[] th[] us[] of a proc[]ssion," thought sh[], "if p[]opl[] had all to li[] down upon th[]ir fac[]s, so that th[]y couldn't s[][] it?" So sh[] stood still wh[]r[] sh[] was, and wait[]d.

Wh[]n th[] proc[]ssion cam[] opposit[] to Alic[], th[]y all stopp[]d and look[]d at h[]r, and th[] Qu[][]n said s[]v[]r[]ly "Who is this?" Sh[] said it to th[] Knav[] of H[]arts, who only bow[]d and smil[]d in r[]ply.

"Idiot!" said th[] Qu[][]n, tossing h[]r h[]ad impati[]ntly; and, turning to Alic[], sh[] w[]nt on, "What's your nam[], child?"

"My nam[] is Alic[], so pl[]as[] your Maj[]sty," said Alic[] v[]ry polit[]ly; but sh[] add[]d, to h[]rs[]lf, "Why, th[]y'r[] only a pack of cards, aft[]r all. I n[][]dn't b[] afraid of th[]m!"

"And who ar[] th[]s[]?" said th[] Qu[][]n, pointing to th[] thr[][] gard[]n[]rs who w[]r[] lying round th[] ros[]-tr[][]; for, you s[][], as th[]y w[]r[] lying on th[]ir fac[]s, and th[] patt[]rn on th[]ir backs was th[] sam[] as th[] r[]st of th[] pack, sh[] could not t[]ll wh[]th[]r th[]y w[]r[] gard[]n[]rs, or soldi[]rs, or courti[]rs, or thr[][] of h[]r own childr[]n.

"How should I know?" said Alic[], surpris[]d at h[]r own courag[]. "It's no busin[]ss of min[]."

Th[] Qu[][]n turn[]d crimson with fury, and, aft[]r glaring at h[]r for a mom[]nt lik[] a wild b[]ast, scr[]am[]d "Off with h[]r h[]ad! Off -- "

"Nons[]ns[]!" said Alic[], v[]ry loudly and d[]cid[]dly, and th[] Qu[][]n was sil[]nt.

Th[] King laid his hand upon h[]r arm, and timidly said "Consid[]r, my d[]ar: sh[] is only a child!"

Th[] Qu[][]n turn[]d angrily away from him, and said to th[] Knav[] "Turn th[]m ov[]r!"

Th[] Knav[] did so, v[]ry car[]fully, with on[] foot.

"G[]t up!" said th[] Qu[][]n, in a shrill, loud voic[], and th[] thr[][] gard[]n[]rs instantly jump[]d up, and b[]gan bowing to th[] King, th[] Qu[][]n, th[] royal childr[]n, and []v[]rybody []ls[].

"L[]av[] off that!" scr[]am[]d th[] Qu[][]n. "You mak[] m[] giddy." And th[]n, turning to th[] ros[]-tr[][], sh[] w[]nt on, "What hav[] you b[][]n doing h[]r[]?"

"May it pl[]as[] your Maj[]sty," said Two, in a v[]ry humbl[] ton[], going down on on[] kn[][] as h[] spok[], "w[] w[]r[] trying -- "

"I s[][]!" said th[] Qu[][]n, who had m[]anwhil[] b[][]n []xamining th[] ros[]s. "Off with th[]ir h[]ads!" and th[] proc[]ssion mov[]d on, thr[][] of th[] soldi[]rs r[]maining b[]hind to []x[]cut[] th[] unfortunat[] gard[]n[]rs, who ran to Alic[] for prot[]ction.

"You shan't b[] b[]h[]ad[]d!" said Alic[], and sh[] put th[]m into a larg[] flow[]r-pot that stood n[]ar. Th[] thr[][] soldi[]rs wand[]r[]d about for a minut[] or two, looking for th[]m, and th[]n qui[]tly march[]d off aft[]r th[] oth[]rs.

"Ar[] th[]ir h[]ads off?" shout[]d th[] Qu[][]n.

"Th[]ir h[]ads ar[] gon[], if it pl[]as[] your Maj[]sty!" th[] soldi[]rs shout[]d in r[]ply.

"That's right!" shout[]d th[] Qu[][]n. "Can you play croqu[]t?"

Th[] soldi[]rs w[]r[] sil[]nt, and look[]d at Alic[], as th[] qu[]stion was []vid[]ntly m[]ant for h[]r.

"Y[]s!" shout[]d Alic[].

"Com[] on, th[]n!" roar[]d th[] Qu[][]n, and Alic[] join[]d th[] proc[]ssion, wond[]ring v[]ry much what would happ[]n n[]xt.

"It's -- it's a v[]ry fin[] day!" said a timid voic[] at h[]r sid[]. Sh[] was walking by th[] Whit[] Rabbit, who was p[][]ping anxiously into h[]r fac[].

"V[]ry," said Alic[]: " -- wh[]r[]'s th[] Duch[]ss?"

"Hush! Hush!" said th[] Rabbit in a low, hurri[]d ton[]. H[] look[]d anxiously ov[]r his should[]r as h[] spok[], and th[]n rais[]d hims[]lf upon tipto[], put his mouth clos[] to h[]r []ar, and whisp[]r[]d "Sh[]'s und[]r s[]nt[]nc[] of []x[]cution."

"What for?" said Alic[].

"Did you say 'What a pity!'?" th[] Rabbit ask[]d.

"No, I didn't," said Alic[]: "I don't think it's at all a pity. I said 'What for?'"

"Sh[] box[]d th[] Qu[][]n's []ars -- " th[] Rabbit b[]gan. Alic[] gav[] a littl[] scr[]am of laught[]r. "Oh, hush!" th[] Rabbit whisp[]r[]d in a fright[]n[]d ton[]. "Th[] Qu[][]n will h[]ar you! You s[][], sh[] cam[] rath[]r lat[], and th[] Qu[][]n said -- "

"G[]t to your plac[]s!" shout[]d th[] Qu[][]n in a voic[] of thund[]r, and p[]opl[] b[]gan running about in all dir[]ctions, tumbling up against []ach oth[]r; how[]v[]r, th[]y got s[]ttl[]d down in a minut[] or two, and th[] gam[] b[]gan. Alic[] thought sh[] had n[]v[]r s[][]n such a curious croqu[]t-ground in h[]r lif[]; it was all ridg[]s and furrows; th[] balls w[]r[] liv[] h[]dg[]hogs, th[] mall[]ts liv[] flamingo[]s, and th[] soldi[]rs had to doubl[] th[]ms[]lv[]s up and to stand on th[]ir hands and f[][]t, to mak[] th[] arch[]s.

Th[] chi[]f difficulty Alic[] found at first was in managing h[]r flamingo: sh[] succ[][]d[]d in g[]tting its body tuck[]d away, comfortably []nough, und[]r h[]r arm, with its l[]gs hanging down, but g[]n[]rally, just as sh[] had got its n[]ck nic[]ly straight[]n[]d out, and was going to giv[] th[] h[]dg[]hog a blow with its h[]ad, it would twist its[]lf round and look up in h[]r fac[], with such a puzzl[]d []xpr[]ssion that sh[] could not h[]lp bursting out laughing: and wh[]n sh[] had got its h[]ad down, and was going to b[]gin again, it was v[]ry provoking to find that th[] h[]dg[]hog had unroll[]d its[]lf, and was in th[] act of crawling away: b[]sid[]s all this, th[]r[] was g[]n[]rally a ridg[] or furrow in th[] way wh[]r[]v[]r sh[] want[]d to s[]nd th[] h[]dg[]hog to, and, as th[] doubl[]d-up soldi[]rs w[]r[] always g[]tting up and walking off to oth[]r parts of th[] ground, Alic[] soon cam[] to th[] conclusion that it was a v[]ry difficult gam[] ind[][]d.

Th[] play[]rs all play[]d at onc[] without waiting for turns, quarr[]lling all th[] whil[], and fighting for th[] h[]dg[]hogs; and in a v[]ry short tim[] th[] Qu[][]n was in a furious passion, and w[]nt stamping about, and shouting "Off with his h[]ad!" or "Off with h[]r h[]ad!" about onc[] in a minut[].

Alic[] b[]gan to f[][]l v[]ry un[]asy: to b[] sur[], sh[] had not as y[]t had any disput[] with th[] Qu[][]n, but sh[] kn[]w that it might happ[]n any minut[], "and th[]n," thought sh[], "what would b[]com[] of m[]? Th[]y'r[] dr[]adfully fond of b[]h[]ading p[]opl[] h[]r[]; th[] gr[]at wond[]r is, that th[]r[]'s any on[] l[]ft aliv[]!"

Sh[] was looking about for som[] way of []scap[], and wond[]ring wh[]th[]r sh[] could g[]t away without b[]ing s[][]n, wh[]n sh[] notic[]d a curious app[]aranc[] in th[] air: it puzzl[]d h[]r v[]ry much at first, but, aft[]r watching it a minut[] or two, sh[] mad[] it out to b[] a grin, and sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf "It's th[] Ch[]shir[] Cat: now I shall hav[] som[]body to talk to."

"How ar[] you g[]tting on?" said th[] Cat, as soon as th[]r[] was mouth []nough for it to sp[]ak with.

Alic[] wait[]d till th[] []y[]s app[]ar[]d, and th[]n nodd[]d. "It's no us[] sp[]aking to it," sh[] thought, "till its []ars hav[] com[], or at l[]ast on[] of th[]m." In anoth[]r minut[] th[] whol[] h[]ad app[]ar[]d, and th[]n Alic[] put down h[]r flamingo, and b[]gan an account of th[] gam[], f[][]ling v[]ry glad sh[] had som[]on[] to list[]n to h[]r. Th[] Cat s[][]m[]d to think that th[]r[] was []nough of it now in sight, and no mor[] of it app[]ar[]d.

"I don't think th[]y play at all fairly," Alic[] b[]gan, in rath[]r a complaining ton[], "and th[]y all quarr[]l so dr[]adfully on[] can't h[]ar on[]s[]lf sp[]ak -- and th[]y don't s[][]m to hav[] any rul[]s in particular; at l[]ast, if th[]r[] ar[], nobody att[]nds to th[]m -- and you'v[] no id[]a how confusing it is all th[] things b[]ing aliv[]; for instanc[], th[]r[]'s th[] arch I'v[] got to go through n[]xt walking about at th[] oth[]r []nd of th[] ground -- and I should hav[] croqu[]t[]d th[] Qu[][]n's h[]dg[]hog just now, only it ran away wh[]n it saw min[] coming!"

"How do you lik[] th[] Qu[][]n?" said th[] Cat in a low voic[].

"Not at all," said Alic[]: "sh[]'s so []xtr[]m[]ly -- " Just th[]n sh[] notic[]d that th[] Qu[][]n was clos[] b[]hind h[]r, list[]ning: so sh[] w[]nt on, " -- lik[]ly to win, that it's hardly worth whil[] finishing th[] gam[]."

Th[] Qu[][]n smil[]d and pass[]d on.

"Who ar[] you talking to?" said th[] King, going up to Alic[], and looking at th[] Cat's h[]ad with gr[]at curiosity.

"It's a fri[]nd of min[] -- a Ch[]shir[] Cat," said Alic[]: "allow m[] to introduc[] it."

"I don't lik[] th[] look of it at all," said th[] King: "how[]v[]r, it may kiss my hand if it lik[]s."

"I'd rath[]r not," th[] Cat r[]mark[]d.

"Don't b[] imp[]rtin[]nt," said th[] King, "and don't look at m[] lik[] that!" H[] got b[]hind Alic[] as h[] spok[].

"A cat may look at a king," said Alic[]. "I'v[] r[]ad that in som[] book, but I don't r[]m[]mb[]r wh[]r[]."

"W[]ll, it must b[] r[]mov[]d," said th[] King v[]ry d[]cid[]dly, and h[] call[]d th[] Qu[][]n, who was passing at th[] mom[]nt, "My d[]ar! I wish you would hav[] this cat r[]mov[]d!"

Th[] Qu[][]n had only on[] way of s[]ttling all difficulti[]s, gr[]at or small. "Off with his h[]ad!" sh[] said, without []v[]n looking round.

"I'll f[]tch th[] []x[]cution[]r mys[]lf," said th[] King []ag[]rly, and h[] hurri[]d off.

Alic[] thought sh[] might as w[]ll go back, and s[][] how th[] gam[] was going on, as sh[] h[]ard th[] Qu[][]n's voic[] in th[] distanc[], scr[]aming with passion. Sh[] had alr[]ady h[]ard h[]r s[]nt[]nc[] thr[][] of th[] play[]rs to b[] []x[]cut[]d for having miss[]d th[]ir turns, and sh[] did not lik[] th[] look of things at all, as th[] gam[] was in such confusion that sh[] n[]v[]r kn[]w wh[]th[]r it was h[]r turn or not. So sh[] w[]nt in s[]arch of h[]r h[]dg[]hog.

Th[] h[]dg[]hog was []ngag[]d in a fight with anoth[]r h[]dg[]hog, which s[][]m[]d to Alic[] an []xc[]ll[]nt opportunity for croqu[]ting on[] of th[]m with th[] oth[]r: th[] only difficulty was, that h[]r flamingo was gon[] across to th[] oth[]r sid[] of th[] gard[]n, wh[]r[] Alic[] could s[][] it trying in a h[]lpl[]ss sort of way to fly up into a tr[][].

By th[] tim[] sh[] had caught th[] flamingo and brought it back, th[] fight was ov[]r, and both th[] h[]dg[]hogs w[]r[] out of sight: "but it do[]sn't matt[]r much," thought Alic[], "as all th[] arch[]s ar[] gon[] from this sid[] of th[] ground." So sh[] tuck[]d it away und[]r h[]r arm, that it might not []scap[] again, and w[]nt back for a littl[] mor[] conv[]rsation with h[]r fri[]nd.

Wh[]n sh[] got back to th[] Ch[]shir[] Cat, sh[] was surpris[]d to find quit[] a larg[] crowd coll[]ct[]d round it: th[]r[] was a disput[] going on b[]tw[][]n th[] []x[]cution[]r, th[] King, and th[] Qu[][]n, who w[]r[] all talking at onc[], whil[] all th[] r[]st w[]r[] quit[] sil[]nt, and look[]d v[]ry uncomfortabl[].

Th[] mom[]nt Alic[] app[]ar[]d, sh[] was app[]al[]d to by all thr[][] to s[]ttl[] th[] qu[]stion, and th[]y r[]p[]at[]d th[]ir argum[]nts to h[]r, though, as th[]y all spok[] at onc[], sh[] found it v[]ry hard ind[][]d to mak[] out []xactly what th[]y said.

Th[] []x[]cution[]r's argum[]nt was, that you couldn't cut off a h[]ad unl[]ss th[]r[] was a body to cut it off from: that h[] had n[]v[]r had to do such a thing b[]for[], and h[] wasn't going to b[]gin at his tim[] of lif[].

Th[] King's argum[]nt was, that anything that had a h[]ad could b[] b[]h[]ad[]d, and that you w[]r[]n't to talk nons[]ns[].

Th[] Qu[][]n's argum[]nt was, that if som[]thing wasn't don[] about it in l[]ss than no tim[] sh[]'d hav[] []v[]rybody []x[]cut[]d, all round. (It was this last r[]mark that had mad[] th[] whol[] party look so grav[] and anxious.)

Alic[] could think of nothing []ls[] to say but "It b[]longs to th[] Duch[]ss: you'd b[]tt[]r ask h[]r about it."

"Sh[]'s in prison," th[] Qu[][]n said to th[] []x[]cution[]r: "f[]tch h[]r h[]r[]." And th[] []x[]cution[]r w[]nt off lik[] an arrow.

Th[] Cat's h[]ad b[]gan fading away th[] mom[]nt h[] was gon[], and, by th[] tim[] h[] had com[] back with th[] Duch[]ss, it had []ntir[]ly disapp[]ar[]d; so th[] King and th[] []x[]cution[]r ran wildly up and down looking for it, whil[] th[] r[]st of th[] party w[]nt back to th[] gam[].

CHAPTER IX.
Th[] Mock Turtl[]'s Story
"You can't think how glad I am to s[][] you again, you d[]ar old thing!" said th[] Duch[]ss, as sh[] tuck[]d h[]r arm aff[]ctionat[]ly into Alic[]'s, and th[]y walk[]d off tog[]th[]r.

Alic[] was v[]ry glad to find h[]r in such a pl[]asant t[]mp[]r, and thought to h[]rs[]lf that p[]rhaps it was only th[] p[]pp[]r that had mad[] h[]r so savag[] wh[]n th[]y m[]t in th[] kitch[]n.

"Wh[]n I'm a Duch[]ss," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf, (not in a v[]ry hop[]ful ton[] though), "I won't hav[] any p[]pp[]r in my kitch[]n at all. Soup do[]s v[]ry w[]ll without -- Mayb[] it's always p[]pp[]r that mak[]s p[]opl[] hot-t[]mp[]r[]d," sh[] w[]nt on, v[]ry much pl[]as[]d at having found out a n[]w kind of rul[], "and vin[]gar that mak[]s th[]m sour -- and camomil[] that mak[]s th[]m bitt[]r -- and -- and barl[]y-sugar and such things that mak[] childr[]n sw[][]t-t[]mp[]r[]d. I only wish p[]opl[] kn[]w that: th[]n th[]y wouldn't b[] so stingy about it, you know -- "

Sh[] had quit[] forgott[]n th[] Duch[]ss by this tim[], and was a littl[] startl[]d wh[]n sh[] h[]ard h[]r voic[] clos[] to h[]r []ar. "You'r[] thinking about som[]thing, my d[]ar, and that mak[]s you forg[]t to talk. I can't t[]ll you just now what th[] moral of that is, but I shall r[]m[]mb[]r it in a bit."

"P[]rhaps it hasn't on[]," Alic[] v[]ntur[]d to r[]mark.

"Tut, tut, child!" said th[] Duch[]ss. "Ev[]rything's got a moral, if only you can find it." And sh[] squ[][]z[]d h[]rs[]lf up clos[]r to Alic[]'s sid[] as sh[] spok[].

Alic[] did not much lik[] k[][]ping so clos[] to h[]r: first, b[]caus[] th[] Duch[]ss was v[]ry ugly; and s[]condly, b[]caus[] sh[] was []xactly th[] right h[]ight to r[]st h[]r chin upon Alic[]'s should[]r, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. How[]v[]r, sh[] did not lik[] to b[] rud[], so sh[] bor[] it as w[]ll as sh[] could.

"Th[] gam[]'s going on rath[]r b[]tt[]r now," sh[] said, by way of k[][]ping up th[] conv[]rsation a littl[].

"'Tis so," said th[] Duch[]ss: "and th[] moral of that is -- 'Oh, 'tis lov[], 'tis lov[], that mak[]s th[] world go round!'"

"Som[]body said," Alic[] whisp[]r[]d, "that it's don[] by []v[]rybody minding th[]ir own busin[]ss!"

"Ah, w[]ll! It m[]ans much th[] sam[] thing," said th[] Duch[]ss, digging h[]r sharp littl[] chin into Alic[]'s should[]r as sh[] add[]d, "and th[] moral of that is -- 'Tak[] car[] of th[] s[]ns[], and th[] sounds will tak[] car[] of th[]ms[]lv[]s.'"

"How fond sh[] is of finding morals in things!" Alic[] thought to h[]rs[]lf.

"I dar[] say you'r[] wond[]ring why I don't put my arm round your waist," th[] Duch[]ss said aft[]r a paus[]: "th[] r[]ason is, that I'm doubtful about th[] t[]mp[]r of your flamingo. Shall I try th[] []xp[]rim[]nt?"

"H[] might bit[]," Alic[] cautiously r[]pli[]d, not f[][]ling at all anxious to hav[] th[] []xp[]rim[]nt tri[]d.

"V[]ry tru[]," said th[] Duch[]ss: "flamingo[]s and mustard both bit[]. And th[] moral of that is -- 'Birds of a f[]ath[]r flock tog[]th[]r.'"

"Only mustard isn't a bird," Alic[] r[]mark[]d.

"Right, as usual," said th[] Duch[]ss: "what a cl[]ar way you hav[] of putting things!"

"It's a min[]ral, I think," said Alic[].

"Of cours[] it is," said th[] Duch[]ss, who s[][]m[]d r[]ady to agr[][] to []v[]rything that Alic[] said; "th[]r[]'s a larg[] mustard-min[] n[]ar h[]r[]. And th[] moral of that is -- 'Th[] mor[] th[]r[] is of min[], th[] l[]ss th[]r[] is of yours.'"

"Oh, I know!" []xclaim[]d Alic[], who had not att[]nd[]d to this last r[]mark, "it's a v[]g[]tabl[]. It do[]sn't look lik[] on[], but it is."

"I quit[] agr[][] with you," said th[] Duch[]ss; "and th[] moral of that is -- 'B[] what you would s[][]m to b[]' -- or if you'd lik[] it put mor[] simply -- 'N[]v[]r imagin[] yours[]lf not to b[] oth[]rwis[] than what it might app[]ar to oth[]rs that what you w[]r[] or might hav[] b[][]n was not oth[]rwis[] than what you had b[][]n would hav[] app[]ar[]d to th[]m to b[] oth[]rwis[].'"

"I think I should und[]rstand that b[]tt[]r," Alic[] said v[]ry polit[]ly, "if I had it writt[]n down: but I can't quit[] follow it as you say it."

"That's nothing to what I could say if I chos[]," th[] Duch[]ss r[]pli[]d, in a pl[]as[]d ton[].

"Pray don't troubl[] yours[]lf to say it any long[]r than that," said Alic[].

"Oh, don't talk about troubl[]!" said th[] Duch[]ss. "I mak[] you a pr[]s[]nt of []v[]rything I'v[] said as y[]t."

"A ch[]ap sort of pr[]s[]nt!" thought Alic[]. "I'm glad th[]y don't giv[] birthday pr[]s[]nts lik[] that!" But sh[] did not v[]ntur[] to say it out loud.

"Thinking again?" th[] Duch[]ss ask[]d, with anoth[]r dig of h[]r sharp littl[] chin.

"I'v[] a right to think," said Alic[] sharply, for sh[] was b[]ginning to f[][]l a littl[] worri[]d.

"Just about as much right," said th[] Duch[]ss, "as pigs hav[] to fly; and th[] m -- "

But h[]r[], to Alic[]'s gr[]at surpris[], th[] Duch[]ss's voic[] di[]d away, []v[]n in th[] middl[] of h[]r favourit[] word 'moral,' and th[] arm that was link[]d into h[]rs b[]gan to tr[]mbl[]. Alic[] look[]d up, and th[]r[] stood th[] Qu[][]n in front of th[]m, with h[]r arms fold[]d, frowning lik[] a thund[]rstorm.

"A fin[] day, your Maj[]sty!" th[] Duch[]ss b[]gan in a low, w[]ak voic[].

"Now, I giv[] you fair warning," shout[]d th[] Qu[][]n, stamping on th[] ground as sh[] spok[]; "[]ith[]r you or your h[]ad must b[] off, and that in about half no tim[]! Tak[] your choic[]!"

Th[] Duch[]ss took h[]r choic[], and was gon[] in a mom[]nt.

"L[]t's go on with th[] gam[]," th[] Qu[][]n said to Alic[]; and Alic[] was too much fright[]n[]d to say a word, but slowly follow[]d h[]r back to th[] croqu[]t-ground.

Th[] oth[]r gu[]sts had tak[]n advantag[] of th[] Qu[][]n's abs[]nc[], and w[]r[] r[]sting in th[] shad[]: how[]v[]r, th[] mom[]nt th[]y saw h[]r, th[]y hurri[]d back to th[] gam[], th[] Qu[][]n m[]r[]ly r[]marking that a mom[]nt's d[]lay would cost th[]m th[]ir liv[]s.

All th[] tim[] th[]y w[]r[] playing th[] Qu[][]n n[]v[]r l[]ft off quarr[]lling with th[] oth[]r play[]rs, and shouting "Off with his h[]ad!" or "Off with h[]r h[]ad!" Thos[] whom sh[] s[]nt[]nc[]d w[]r[] tak[]n into custody by th[] soldi[]rs, who of cours[] had to l[]av[] off b[]ing arch[]s to do this, so that by th[] []nd of half an hour or so th[]r[] w[]r[] no arch[]s l[]ft, and all th[] play[]rs, []xc[]pt th[] King, th[] Qu[][]n, and Alic[], w[]r[] in custody and und[]r s[]nt[]nc[] of []x[]cution.

Th[]n th[] Qu[][]n l[]ft off, quit[] out of br[]ath, and said to Alic[], "Hav[] you s[][]n th[] Mock Turtl[] y[]t?"

"No," said Alic[]. "I don't []v[]n know what a Mock Turtl[] is."

"It's th[] thing Mock Turtl[] Soup is mad[] from," said th[] Qu[][]n.

"I n[]v[]r saw on[], or h[]ard of on[]," said Alic[].

"Com[] on, th[]n," said th[] Qu[][]n, "and h[] shall t[]ll you his history,"

As th[]y walk[]d off tog[]th[]r, Alic[] h[]ard th[] King say in a low voic[], to th[] company g[]n[]rally, "You ar[] all pardon[]d." "Com[], that's a good thing!" sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf, for sh[] had f[]lt quit[] unhappy at th[] numb[]r of []x[]cutions th[] Qu[][]n had ord[]r[]d.

Th[]y v[]ry soon cam[] upon a Gryphon, lying fast asl[][]p in th[] sun. (If you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at th[] pictur[].) "Up, lazy thing!" said th[] Qu[][]n, "and tak[] this young lady to s[][] th[] Mock Turtl[], and to h[]ar his history. I must go back and s[][] aft[]r som[] []x[]cutions I hav[] ord[]r[]d;" and sh[] walk[]d off, l[]aving Alic[] alon[] with th[] Gryphon. Alic[] did not quit[] lik[] th[] look of th[] cr[]atur[], but on th[] whol[] sh[] thought it would b[] quit[] as saf[] to stay with it as to go aft[]r that savag[] Qu[][]n: so sh[] wait[]d.

Th[] Gryphon sat up and rubb[]d its []y[]s: th[]n it watch[]d th[] Qu[][]n till sh[] was out of sight: th[]n it chuckl[]d. "What fun!" said th[] Gryphon, half to its[]lf, half to Alic[].

"What is th[] fun?" said Alic[].

"Why, sh[]," said th[] Gryphon. "It's all h[]r fancy, that: th[]y n[]v[]r []x[]cut[]s nobody, you know. Com[] on!"

"Ev[]rybody says 'com[] on!' h[]r[]," thought Alic[], as sh[] w[]nt slowly aft[]r it: "I n[]v[]r was so ord[]r[]d about in all my lif[], n[]v[]r!"

Th[]y had not gon[] far b[]for[] th[]y saw th[] Mock Turtl[] in th[] distanc[], sitting sad and lon[]ly on a littl[] l[]dg[] of rock, and, as th[]y cam[] n[]ar[]r, Alic[] could h[]ar him sighing as if his h[]art would br[]ak. Sh[] piti[]d him d[][]ply. "What is his sorrow?" sh[] ask[]d th[] Gryphon, and th[] Gryphon answ[]r[]d, v[]ry n[]arly in th[] sam[] words as b[]for[], "It's all his fancy, that: h[] hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Com[] on!"

So th[]y w[]nt up to th[] Mock Turtl[], who look[]d at th[]m with larg[] []y[]s full of t[]ars, but said nothing.

"This h[]r[] young lady," said th[] Gryphon, "sh[] wants for to know your history, sh[] do."

"I'll t[]ll it h[]r," said th[] Mock Turtl[] in a d[][]p, hollow ton[]: "sit down, both of you, and don't sp[]ak a word till I'v[] finish[]d."

So th[]y sat down, and nobody spok[] for som[] minut[]s. Alic[] thought to h[]rs[]lf, "I don't s[][] how h[] can []v[]r finish, if h[] do[]sn't b[]gin." But sh[] wait[]d pati[]ntly.

"Onc[]," said th[] Mock Turtl[] at last, with a d[][]p sigh, "I was a r[]al Turtl[]."

Th[]s[] words w[]r[] follow[]d by a v[]ry long sil[]nc[], brok[]n only by an occasional []xclamation of "Hjckrrh!" from th[] Gryphon, and th[] constant h[]avy sobbing of th[] Mock Turtl[]. Alic[] was v[]ry n[]arly g[]tting up and saying, "Thank you, sir, for your int[]r[]sting story," but sh[] could not h[]lp thinking th[]r[] must b[] mor[] to com[], so sh[] sat still and said nothing.

"Wh[]n w[] w[]r[] littl[]," th[] Mock Turtl[] w[]nt on at last, mor[] calmly, though still sobbing a littl[] now and th[]n, "w[] w[]nt to school in th[] s[]a. Th[] mast[]r was an old Turtl[] -- w[] us[]d to call him Tortois[] -- "

"Why did you call him Tortois[], if h[] wasn't on[]?" Alic[] ask[]d.

"W[] call[]d him Tortois[] b[]caus[] h[] taught us," said th[] Mock Turtl[] angrily: "r[]ally you ar[] v[]ry dull!"

"You ought to b[] asham[]d of yours[]lf for asking such a simpl[] qu[]stion," add[]d th[] Gryphon; and th[]n th[]y both sat sil[]nt and look[]d at poor Alic[], who f[]lt r[]ady to sink into th[] []arth. At last th[] Gryphon said to th[] Mock Turtl[], "Driv[] on, old f[]llow! Don't b[] all day about it!" and h[] w[]nt on in th[]s[] words:

"Y[]s, w[] w[]nt to school in th[] s[]a, though you mayn't b[]li[]v[] it -- "

"I n[]v[]r said I didn't!" int[]rrupt[]d Alic[].

"You did," said th[] Mock Turtl[].

"Hold your tongu[]!" add[]d th[] Gryphon, b[]for[] Alic[] could sp[]ak again. Th[] Mock Turtl[] w[]nt on.

"W[] had th[] b[]st of []ducations -- in fact, w[] w[]nt to school []v[]ry day -- "

"I'v[] b[][]n to a day-school, too," said Alic[]; "you n[][]dn't b[] so proud as all that."

"With []xtras?" ask[]d th[] Mock Turtl[] a littl[] anxiously.

"Y[]s," said Alic[], "w[] l[]arn[]d Fr[]nch and music."

"And washing?" said th[] Mock Turtl[].

"C[]rtainly not!" said Alic[] indignantly.

"Ah! th[]n yours wasn't a r[]ally good school," said th[] Mock Turtl[] in a ton[] of gr[]at r[]li[]f. "Now at ours th[]y had at th[] []nd of th[] bill, 'Fr[]nch, music, and washing -- []xtra.'"

"You couldn't hav[] want[]d it much," said Alic[]; "living at th[] bottom of th[] s[]a."

"I couldn't afford to l[]arn it." said th[] Mock Turtl[] with a sigh. "I only took th[] r[]gular cours[]."

"What was that?" inquir[]d Alic[].

"R[][]ling and Writhing, of cours[], to b[]gin with," th[] Mock Turtl[] r[]pli[]d; "and th[]n th[] diff[]r[]nt branch[]s of Arithm[]tic -- Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and D[]rision."

"I n[]v[]r h[]ard of 'Uglification,'" Alic[] v[]ntur[]d to say. "What is it?"

Th[] Gryphon lift[]d up both its paws in surpris[]. "What! N[]v[]r h[]ard of uglifying!" it []xclaim[]d. "You know what to b[]autify is, I suppos[]?"

"Y[]s," said Alic[] doubtfully: "it m[]ans -- to -- mak[] -- anything -- pr[]tti[]r."

"W[]ll, th[]n," th[] Gryphon w[]nt on, "if you don't know what to uglify is, you ar[] a simpl[]ton."

Alic[] did not f[][]l []ncourag[]d to ask any mor[] qu[]stions about it, so sh[] turn[]d to th[] Mock Turtl[], and said "What []ls[] had you to l[]arn?"

"W[]ll, th[]r[] was Myst[]ry," th[] Mock Turtl[] r[]pli[]d, counting off th[] subj[]cts on his flapp[]rs, " -- Myst[]ry, anci[]nt and mod[]rn, with S[]aography: th[]n Drawling -- th[] Drawling-mast[]r was an old cong[]r-[][]l, that us[]d to com[] onc[] a w[][]k: h[] taught us Drawling, Str[]tching, and Fainting in Coils."

"What was that lik[]?" said Alic[].

"W[]ll, I can't show it you mys[]lf," th[] Mock Turtl[] said: "I'm too stiff. And th[] Gryphon n[]v[]r l[]arnt it."

"Hadn't tim[]," said th[] Gryphon: "I w[]nt to th[] Classics mast[]r, though. H[] was an old crab, h[] was."

"I n[]v[]r w[]nt to him," th[] Mock Turtl[] said with a sigh: "h[] taught Laughing and Gri[]f, th[]y us[]d to say."

"So h[] did, so h[] did," said th[] Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both cr[]atur[]s hid th[]ir fac[]s in th[]ir paws.

"And how many hours a day did you do l[]ssons?" said Alic[], in a hurry to chang[] th[] subj[]ct.

"T[]n hours th[] first day," said th[] Mock Turtl[]: "nin[] th[] n[]xt, and so on."

"What a curious plan!" []xclaim[]d Alic[].

"That's th[] r[]ason th[]y'r[] call[]d l[]ssons," th[] Gryphon r[]mark[]d: "b[]caus[] th[]y l[]ss[]n from day to day."

This was quit[] a n[]w id[]a to Alic[], and sh[] thought it ov[]r a littl[] b[]for[] sh[] mad[] h[]r n[]xt r[]mark. "Th[]n th[] []l[]v[]nth day must hav[] b[][]n a holiday?"

"Of cours[] it was," said th[] Mock Turtl[].

"And how did you manag[] on th[] tw[]lfth?" Alic[] w[]nt on []ag[]rly.

"That's []nough about l[]ssons," th[] Gryphon int[]rrupt[]d in a v[]ry d[]cid[]d ton[]: "t[]ll h[]r som[]thing about th[] gam[]s now."

CHAPTER X.
Th[] Lobst[]r Quadrill[]
Th[] Mock Turtl[] sigh[]d d[][]ply, and dr[]w th[] back of on[] flapp[]r across his []y[]s. H[] look[]d at Alic[], and tri[]d to sp[]ak, but for a minut[] or two sobs chok[]d his voic[]. "Sam[] as if h[] had a bon[] in his throat," said th[] Gryphon: and it s[]t to work shaking him and punching him in th[] back. At last th[] Mock Turtl[] r[]cov[]r[]d his voic[], and, with t[]ars running down his ch[][]ks, h[] w[]nt on again: -- 

"You may not hav[] liv[]d much und[]r th[] s[]a -- " ("I hav[]n't," said Alic[]) -- "and p[]rhaps you w[]r[] n[]v[]r []v[]n introduc[]d to a lobst[]r -- " (Alic[] b[]gan to say "I onc[] tast[]d -- " but ch[]ck[]d h[]rs[]lf hastily, and said "No, n[]v[]r") " -- so you can hav[] no id[]a what a d[]lightful thing a Lobst[]r Quadrill[] is!"

"No, ind[][]d," said Alic[]. "What sort of a danc[] is it?"

"Why," said th[] Gryphon, "you first form into a lin[] along th[] s[]a-shor[] -- "

"Two lin[]s!" cri[]d th[] Mock Turtl[]. "S[]als, turtl[]s, salmon, and so on; th[]n, wh[]n you'v[] cl[]ar[]d all th[] j[]lly-fish out of th[] way -- "

"That g[]n[]rally tak[]s som[] tim[]," int[]rrupt[]d th[] Gryphon.

" -- you advanc[] twic[] -- "

"Each with a lobst[]r as a partn[]r!" cri[]d th[] Gryphon.

"Of cours[]," th[] Mock Turtl[] said: "advanc[] twic[], s[]t to partn[]rs -- "

" -- chang[] lobst[]rs, and r[]tir[] in sam[] ord[]r," continu[]d th[] Gryphon.

"Th[]n, you know," th[] Mock Turtl[] w[]nt on, "you throw th[] -- "

"Th[] lobst[]rs!" shout[]d th[] Gryphon, with a bound into th[] air.

" -- as far out to s[]a as you can -- "

"Swim aft[]r th[]m!" scr[]am[]d th[] Gryphon.

"Turn a som[]rsault in th[] s[]a!" cri[]d th[] Mock Turtl[], cap[]ring wildly about.

"Chang[] lobst[]rs again!" y[]ll[]d th[] Gryphon at th[] top of its voic[].

"Back to land again, and that's all th[] first figur[]," said th[] Mock Turtl[], sudd[]nly dropping his voic[]; and th[] two cr[]atur[]s, who had b[][]n jumping about lik[] mad things all this tim[], sat down again v[]ry sadly and qui[]tly, and look[]d at Alic[].

"It must b[] a v[]ry pr[]tty danc[]," said Alic[] timidly.

"Would you lik[] to s[][] a littl[] of it?" said th[] Mock Turtl[].

"V[]ry much ind[][]d," said Alic[].

"Com[], l[]t's try th[] first figur[]!" said th[] Mock Turtl[] to th[] Gryphon. "W[] can do without lobst[]rs, you know. Which shall sing?"

"Oh, you sing," said th[] Gryphon. "I'v[] forgott[]n th[] words."

So th[]y b[]gan sol[]mnly dancing round and round Alic[], []v[]ry now and th[]n tr[]ading on h[]r to[]s wh[]n th[]y pass[]d too clos[], and waving th[]ir for[]paws to mark th[] tim[], whil[] th[] Mock Turtl[] sang this, v[]ry slowly and sadly: -- 

"Will you walk a littl[] fast[]r?" said a whiting to a snail.
"Th[]r[]'s a porpois[] clos[] b[]hind us, and h[]'s tr[]ading on my tail.
S[][] how []ag[]rly th[] lobst[]rs and th[] turtl[]s all advanc[]!
Th[]y ar[] waiting on th[] shingl[] -- will you com[] and join th[] danc[]?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join th[] danc[]?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join th[] danc[]?

"You can r[]ally hav[] no notion how d[]lightful it will b[]
Wh[]n th[]y tak[] us up and throw us, with th[] lobst[]rs, out to s[]a!"
But th[] snail r[]pli[]d "Too far, too far!" and gav[] a look askanc[] -- 
Said h[] thank[]d th[] whiting kindly, but h[] would not join th[] danc[].
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join th[] danc[].
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join th[] danc[].

"What matt[]rs it how far w[] go?" his scaly fri[]nd r[]pli[]d.
"Th[]r[] is anoth[]r shor[], you know, upon th[] oth[]r sid[].
Th[] furth[]r off from England th[] n[]ar[]r is to Franc[] -- 
Th[]n turn not pal[], b[]lov[]d snail, but com[] and join th[] danc[].
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join th[] danc[]?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join th[] danc[]?"

"Thank you, it's a v[]ry int[]r[]sting danc[] to watch," said Alic[], f[][]ling v[]ry glad that it was ov[]r at last: "and I do so lik[] that curious song about th[] whiting!"

"Oh, as to th[] whiting," said th[] Mock Turtl[], "th[]y -- you'v[] s[][]n th[]m, of cours[]?"

"Y[]s," said Alic[], "I'v[] oft[]n s[][]n th[]m at dinn -- " sh[] ch[]ck[]d h[]rs[]lf hastily.

"I don't know wh[]r[] Dinn may b[]," said th[] Mock Turtl[], "but if you'v[] s[][]n th[]m so oft[]n, of cours[] you know what th[]y'r[] lik[]."

"I b[]li[]v[] so," Alic[] r[]pli[]d thoughtfully. "Th[]y hav[] th[]ir tails in th[]ir mouths -- and th[]y'r[] all ov[]r crumbs."

"You'r[] wrong about th[] crumbs," said th[] Mock Turtl[]: "crumbs would all wash off in th[] s[]a. But th[]y hav[] th[]ir tails in th[]ir mouths; and th[] r[]ason is -- " h[]r[] th[] Mock Turtl[] yawn[]d and shut his []y[]s. -- "T[]ll h[]r about th[] r[]ason and all that," h[] said to th[] Gryphon.

"Th[] r[]ason is," said th[] Gryphon, "that th[]y would go with th[] lobst[]rs to th[] danc[]. So th[]y got thrown out to s[]a. So th[]y had to fall a long way. So th[]y got th[]ir tails fast in th[]ir mouths. So th[]y couldn't g[]t th[]m out again. That's all."

"Thank you," said Alic[], "it's v[]ry int[]r[]sting. I n[]v[]r kn[]w so much about a whiting b[]for[]."

"I can t[]ll you mor[] than that, if you lik[]," said th[] Gryphon. "Do you know why it's call[]d a whiting?"

"I n[]v[]r thought about it," said Alic[]. "Why?"

"It do[]s th[] boots and sho[]s," th[] Gryphon r[]pli[]d v[]ry sol[]mnly.

Alic[] was thoroughly puzzl[]d. "Do[]s th[] boots and sho[]s!" sh[] r[]p[]at[]d in a wond[]ring ton[].

"Why, what ar[] your sho[]s don[] with?" said th[] Gryphon. "I m[]an, what mak[]s th[]m so shiny?"

Alic[] look[]d down at th[]m, and consid[]r[]d a littl[] b[]for[] sh[] gav[] h[]r answ[]r. "Th[]y'r[] don[] with blacking, I b[]li[]v[]."

"Boots and sho[]s und[]r th[] s[]a," th[] Gryphon w[]nt on in a d[][]p voic[], "ar[] don[] with a whiting. Now you know."

"And what ar[] th[]y mad[] of?" Alic[] ask[]d in a ton[] of gr[]at curiosity.

"Sol[]s and [][]ls, of cours[]," th[] Gryphon r[]pli[]d rath[]r impati[]ntly: "any shrimp could hav[] told you that."

"If I'd b[][]n th[] whiting," said Alic[], whos[] thoughts w[]r[] still running on th[] song, "I'd hav[] said to th[] porpois[], 'K[][]p back, pl[]as[]: w[] don't want you with us!'"

"Th[]y w[]r[] oblig[]d to hav[] him with th[]m," th[] Mock Turtl[] said: "no wis[] fish would go anywh[]r[] without a porpois[]."

"Wouldn't it r[]ally?" said Alic[] in a ton[] of gr[]at surpris[].

"Of cours[] not," said th[] Mock Turtl[]: "why, if a fish cam[] to m[], and told m[] h[] was going a journ[]y, I should say 'With what porpois[]?'"

"Don't you m[]an 'purpos[]'?" said Alic[].

"I m[]an what I say," th[] Mock Turtl[] r[]pli[]d in an off[]nd[]d ton[]. And th[] Gryphon add[]d "Com[], l[]t's h[]ar som[] of your adv[]ntur[]s."

"I could t[]ll you my adv[]ntur[]s -- b[]ginning from this morning," said Alic[] a littl[] timidly: "but it's no us[] going back to y[]st[]rday, b[]caus[] I was a diff[]r[]nt p[]rson th[]n."

"Explain all that," said th[] Mock Turtl[].

"No, no! Th[] adv[]ntur[]s first," said th[] Gryphon in an impati[]nt ton[]: "[]xplanations tak[] such a dr[]adful tim[]."

So Alic[] b[]gan t[]lling th[]m h[]r adv[]ntur[]s from th[] tim[] wh[]n sh[] first saw th[] Whit[] Rabbit. Sh[] was a littl[] n[]rvous about it just at first, th[] two cr[]atur[]s got so clos[] to h[]r, on[] on []ach sid[], and op[]n[]d th[]ir []y[]s and mouths so v[]ry wid[], but sh[] gain[]d courag[] as sh[] w[]nt on. H[]r list[]n[]rs w[]r[] p[]rf[]ctly qui[]t till sh[] got to th[] part about h[]r r[]p[]ating "You ar[] old, Fath[]r William," to th[] Cat[]rpillar, and th[] words all coming diff[]r[]nt, and th[]n th[] Mock Turtl[] dr[]w a long br[]ath, and said "That's v[]ry curious."

"It's all about as curious as it can b[]," said th[] Gryphon.

"It all cam[] diff[]r[]nt!" th[] Mock Turtl[] r[]p[]at[]d thoughtfully. "I should lik[] to h[]ar h[]r try and r[]p[]at som[]thing now. T[]ll h[]r to b[]gin." H[] look[]d at th[] Gryphon as if h[] thought it had som[] kind of authority ov[]r Alic[].

"Stand up and r[]p[]at ''Tis th[] voic[] of th[] sluggard,'" said th[] Gryphon.

"How th[] cr[]atur[]s ord[]r on[] about, and mak[] on[] r[]p[]at l[]ssons!" thought Alic[]; "I might as w[]ll b[] at school at onc[]." How[]v[]r, sh[] got up, and b[]gan to r[]p[]at it, but h[]r h[]ad was so full of th[] Lobst[]r Quadrill[], that sh[] hardly kn[]w what sh[] was saying, and th[] words cam[] v[]ry qu[][]r ind[][]d: -- 

"'Tis th[] voic[] of th[] Lobst[]r; I h[]ard him d[]clar[],
"You hav[] bak[]d m[] too brown, I must sugar my hair."
As a duck with its []y[]lids, so h[] with his nos[]
Trims his b[]lt and his buttons, and turns out his to[]s."

[lat[]r []ditions continu[]d as follows
Wh[]n th[] sands ar[] all dry, h[] is gay as a lark,
And will talk in cont[]mptuous ton[]s of th[] Shark,
But, wh[]n th[] tid[] ris[]s and sharks ar[] around,
His voic[] has a timid and tr[]mulous sound.]

"That's diff[]r[]nt from what I us[]d to say wh[]n I was a child," said th[] Gryphon.

"W[]ll, I n[]v[]r h[]ard it b[]for[]," said th[] Mock Turtl[]; "but it sounds uncommon nons[]ns[]."

Alic[] said nothing; sh[] had sat down with h[]r fac[] in h[]r hands, wond[]ring if anything would []v[]r happ[]n in a natural way again.

"I should lik[] to hav[] it []xplain[]d," said th[] Mock Turtl[].

"Sh[] can't []xplain it," said th[] Gryphon hastily. "Go on with th[] n[]xt v[]rs[]."

"But about his to[]s?" th[] Mock Turtl[] p[]rsist[]d. "How could h[] turn th[]m out with his nos[], you know?"

"It's th[] first position in dancing." Alic[] said; but was dr[]adfully puzzl[]d by th[] whol[] thing, and long[]d to chang[] th[] subj[]ct.

"Go on with th[] n[]xt v[]rs[]," th[] Gryphon r[]p[]at[]d impati[]ntly: "it b[]gins 'I pass[]d by his gard[]n.'"

Alic[] did not dar[] to disob[]y, though sh[] f[]lt sur[] it would all com[] wrong, and sh[] w[]nt on in a tr[]mbling voic[]: -- 

"I pass[]d by his gard[]n, and mark[]d, with on[] []y[],
How th[] Owl and th[] Panth[]r w[]r[] sharing a pi[] -- "

[lat[]r []ditions continu[]d as follows
Th[] Panth[]r took pi[]-crust, and gravy, and m[]at,
Whil[] th[] Owl had th[] dish as its shar[] of th[] tr[]at.
Wh[]n th[] pi[] was all finish[]d, th[] Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly p[]rmitt[]d to pock[]t th[] spoon:
Whil[] th[] Panth[]r r[]c[]iv[]d knif[] and fork with a growl,
And conclud[]d th[] banqu[]t -- ]

"What is th[] us[] of r[]p[]ating all that stuff," th[] Mock Turtl[] int[]rrupt[]d, "if you don't []xplain it as you go on? It's by far th[] most confusing thing I []v[]r h[]ard!"

"Y[]s, I think you'd b[]tt[]r l[]av[] off," said th[] Gryphon: and Alic[] was only too glad to do so.

"Shall w[] try anoth[]r figur[] of th[] Lobst[]r Quadrill[]?" th[] Gryphon w[]nt on. "Or would you lik[] th[] Mock Turtl[] to sing you a song?"

"Oh, a song, pl[]as[], if th[] Mock Turtl[] would b[] so kind," Alic[] r[]pli[]d, so []ag[]rly that th[] Gryphon said, in a rath[]r off[]nd[]d ton[], "Hm! No accounting for tast[]s! Sing h[]r 'Turtl[] Soup,' will you, old f[]llow?"

Th[] Mock Turtl[] sigh[]d d[][]ply, and b[]gan, in a voic[] som[]tim[]s chok[]d with sobs, to sing this: -- 

"B[]autiful Soup, so rich and gr[][]n,
Waiting in a hot tur[][]n!
Who for such dainti[]s would not stoop?
Soup of th[] []v[]ning, b[]autiful Soup!
Soup of th[] []v[]ning, b[]autiful Soup!
    B[]au -- ootiful Soo -- oop!
    B[]au -- ootiful Soo -- oop!
Soo -- oop of th[] [] -- [] -- []v[]ning,
    B[]autiful, b[]autiful Soup!

"B[]autiful Soup! Who car[]s for fish,

    B[]au -- ootiful Soo -- oop!
Soo -- oop of th[] [] -- [] -- []v[]ning,

"Chorus again!" cri[]d th[] Gryphon, and th[] Mock Turtl[] had just b[]gun to r[]p[]at it, wh[]n a cry of "Th[] trial's b[]ginning!" was h[]ard in th[] distanc[].

"Com[] on!" cri[]d th[] Gryphon, and, taking Alic[] by th[] hand, it hurri[]d off, without waiting for th[] []nd of th[] song.

"What trial is it?" Alic[] pant[]d as sh[] ran; but th[] Gryphon only answ[]r[]d "Com[] on!" and ran th[] fast[]r, whil[] mor[] and mor[] faintly cam[], carri[]d on th[] br[][]z[] that follow[]d th[]m, th[] m[]lancholy words: -- 

"Soo -- oop of th[] [] -- [] -- []v[]ning,
    B[]autiful, b[]autiful Soup!"

CHAPTER XI.
Who Stol[] th[] Tarts?
Th[] King and Qu[][]n of H[]arts w[]r[] s[]at[]d on th[]ir thron[] wh[]n th[]y arriv[]d, with a gr[]at crowd ass[]mbl[]d about th[]m -- all sorts of littl[] birds and b[]asts, as w[]ll as th[] whol[] pack of cards: th[] Knav[] was standing b[]for[] th[]m, in chains, with a soldi[]r on []ach sid[] to guard him; and n[]ar th[] King was th[] Whit[] Rabbit, with a trump[]t in on[] hand, and a scroll of parchm[]nt in th[] oth[]r. In th[] v[]ry middl[] of th[] court was a tabl[], with a larg[] dish of tarts upon it: th[]y look[]d so good, that it mad[] Alic[] quit[] hungry to look at th[]m -- "I wish th[]y'd g[]t th[] trial don[]," sh[] thought, "and hand round th[] r[]fr[]shm[]nts!" But th[]r[] s[][]m[]d to b[] no chanc[] of this, so sh[] b[]gan looking at []v[]rything about h[]r, to pass away th[] tim[].

Alic[] had n[]v[]r b[][]n in a court of justic[] b[]for[], but sh[] had r[]ad about th[]m in books, and sh[] was quit[] pl[]as[]d to find that sh[] kn[]w th[] nam[] of n[]arly []v[]rything th[]r[]. "That's th[] judg[]," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf, "b[]caus[] of his gr[]at wig."

Th[] judg[], by th[] way, was th[] King; and as h[] wor[] his crown ov[]r th[] wig, (look at th[] frontispi[]c[] if you want to s[][] how h[] did it,) h[] did not look at all comfortabl[], and it was c[]rtainly not b[]coming.

"And that's th[] jury-box," thought Alic[], "and thos[] tw[]lv[] cr[]atur[]s," (sh[] was oblig[]d to say "cr[]atur[]s," you s[][], b[]caus[] som[] of th[]m w[]r[] animals, and som[] w[]r[] birds,) "I suppos[] th[]y ar[] th[] jurors." Sh[] said this last word two or thr[][] tim[]s ov[]r to h[]rs[]lf, b[]ing rath[]r proud of it: for sh[] thought, and rightly too, that v[]ry f[]w littl[] girls of h[]r ag[] kn[]w th[] m[]aning of it at all. How[]v[]r, "jury-m[]n" would hav[] don[] just as w[]ll.

Th[] tw[]lv[] jurors w[]r[] all writing v[]ry busily on slat[]s. "What ar[] th[]y doing?" Alic[] whisp[]r[]d to th[] Gryphon. "Th[]y can't hav[] anything to put down y[]t, b[]for[] th[] trial's b[]gun."

"Th[]y'r[] putting down th[]ir nam[]s," th[] Gryphon whisp[]r[]d in r[]ply, "for f[]ar th[]y should forg[]t th[]m b[]for[] th[] []nd of th[] trial."

"Stupid things!" Alic[] b[]gan in a loud, indignant voic[], but sh[] stopp[]d hastily, for th[] Whit[] Rabbit cri[]d out, "Sil[]nc[] in th[] court!" and th[] King put on his sp[]ctacl[]s and look[]d anxiously round, to mak[] out who was talking.

Alic[] could s[][], as w[]ll as if sh[] w[]r[] looking ov[]r th[]ir should[]rs, that all th[] jurors w[]r[] writing down "stupid things!" on th[]ir slat[]s, and sh[] could []v[]n mak[] out that on[] of th[]m didn't know how to sp[]ll "stupid," and that h[] had to ask his n[]ighbour to t[]ll him. "A nic[] muddl[] th[]ir slat[]s'll b[] in b[]for[] th[] trial's ov[]r!" thought Alic[].

On[] of th[] jurors had a p[]ncil that squ[]ak[]d. This of cours[], Alic[] could not stand, and sh[] w[]nt round th[] court and got b[]hind him, and v[]ry soon found an opportunity of taking it away. Sh[] did it so quickly that th[] poor littl[] juror (it was Bill, th[] Lizard) could not mak[] out at all what had b[]com[] of it; so, aft[]r hunting all about for it, h[] was oblig[]d to writ[] with on[] fing[]r for th[] r[]st of th[] day; and this was of v[]ry littl[] us[], as it l[]ft no mark on th[] slat[].

"H[]rald, r[]ad th[] accusation!" said th[] King.

On this th[] Whit[] Rabbit bl[]w thr[][] blasts on th[] trump[]t, and th[]n unroll[]d th[] parchm[]nt scroll, and r[]ad as follows: -- 

"Th[] Qu[][]n of H[]arts, sh[] mad[] som[] tarts,
    All on a summ[]r day:
Th[] Knav[] of H[]arts, h[] stol[] thos[] tarts,
    And took th[]m quit[] away!"

"Consid[]r your v[]rdict," th[] King said to th[] jury.

"Not y[]t, not y[]t!" th[] Rabbit hastily int[]rrupt[]d. "Th[]r[]'s a gr[]at d[]al to com[] b[]for[] that!"

"Call th[] first witn[]ss," said th[] King; and th[] Whit[] Rabbit bl[]w thr[][] blasts on th[] trump[]t, and call[]d out, "First witn[]ss!"

Th[] first witn[]ss was th[] Hatt[]r. H[] cam[] in with a t[]acup in on[] hand and a pi[]c[] of br[]ad-and-butt[]r in th[] oth[]r. "I b[]g pardon, your Maj[]sty," h[] b[]gan, "for bringing th[]s[] in: but I hadn't quit[] finish[]d my t[]a wh[]n I was s[]nt for."

"You ought to hav[] finish[]d," said th[] King. "Wh[]n did you b[]gin?"

Th[] Hatt[]r look[]d at th[] March Har[], who had follow[]d him into th[] court, arm-in-arm with th[] Dormous[]. "Fourt[][]nth of March, I think it was," h[] said.

"Fift[][]nth," said th[] March Har[].

"Sixt[][]nth," add[]d th[] Dormous[].

"Writ[] that down," th[] King said to th[] jury, and th[] jury []ag[]rly wrot[] down all thr[][] dat[]s on th[]ir slat[]s, and th[]n add[]d th[]m up, and r[]duc[]d th[] answ[]r to shillings and p[]nc[].

"Tak[] off your hat," th[] King said to th[] Hatt[]r.

"It isn't min[]," said th[] Hatt[]r.

"Stol[]n!" th[] King []xclaim[]d, turning to th[] jury, who instantly mad[] a m[]morandum of th[] fact.

"I k[][]p th[]m to s[]ll," th[] Hatt[]r add[]d as an []xplanation; "I'v[] non[] of my own. I'm a hatt[]r."

H[]r[] th[] Qu[][]n put on h[]r sp[]ctacl[]s, and b[]gan staring at th[] Hatt[]r, who turn[]d pal[] and fidg[]t[]d.

"Giv[] your []vid[]nc[]," said th[] King; "and don't b[] n[]rvous, or I'll hav[] you []x[]cut[]d on th[] spot."

This did not s[][]m to []ncourag[] th[] witn[]ss at all: h[] k[]pt shifting from on[] foot to th[] oth[]r, looking un[]asily at th[] Qu[][]n, and in his confusion h[] bit a larg[] pi[]c[] out of his t[]acup inst[]ad of th[] br[]ad-and-butt[]r.

Just at this mom[]nt Alic[] f[]lt a v[]ry curious s[]nsation, which puzzl[]d h[]r a good d[]al until sh[] mad[] out what it was: sh[] was b[]ginning to grow larg[]r again, and sh[] thought at first sh[] would g[]t up and l[]av[] th[] court; but on s[]cond thoughts sh[] d[]cid[]d to r[]main wh[]r[] sh[] was as long as th[]r[] was room for h[]r.

"I wish you wouldn't squ[][]z[] so." said th[] Dormous[], who was sitting n[]xt to h[]r. "I can hardly br[]ath[]."

"I can't h[]lp it," said Alic[] v[]ry m[][]kly: "I'm growing."

"You'v[] no right to grow h[]r[]," said th[] Dormous[].

"Don't talk nons[]ns[]," said Alic[] mor[] boldly: "you know you'r[] growing too."

"Y[]s, but I grow at a r[]asonabl[] pac[]," said th[] Dormous[]: "not in that ridiculous fashion." And h[] got up v[]ry sulkily and cross[]d ov[]r to th[] oth[]r sid[] of th[] court.

All this tim[] th[] Qu[][]n had n[]v[]r l[]ft off staring at th[] Hatt[]r, and, just as th[] Dormous[] cross[]d th[] court, sh[] said to on[] of th[] offic[]rs of th[] court, "Bring m[] th[] list of th[] sing[]rs in th[] last conc[]rt!" on which th[] wr[]tch[]d Hatt[]r tr[]mbl[]d so, that h[] shook both his sho[]s off.

"Giv[] your []vid[]nc[]," th[] King r[]p[]at[]d angrily, "or I'll hav[] you []x[]cut[]d, wh[]th[]r you'r[] n[]rvous or not."

"I'm a poor man, your Maj[]sty," th[] Hatt[]r b[]gan, in a tr[]mbling voic[], " -- and I hadn't b[]gun my t[]a -- not abov[] a w[][]k or so -- and what with th[] br[]ad-and-butt[]r g[]tting so thin -- and th[] twinkling of th[] t[]a -- "

"Th[] twinkling of th[] what?" said th[] King.

"It b[]gan with th[] t[]a," th[] Hatt[]r r[]pli[]d.

"Of cours[] twinkling b[]gins with a T!" said th[] King sharply. "Do you tak[] m[] for a dunc[]? Go on!"

"I'm a poor man," th[] Hatt[]r w[]nt on, "and most things twinkl[]d aft[]r that -- only th[] March Har[] said -- "

"I didn't!" th[] March Har[] int[]rrupt[]d in a gr[]at hurry.

"You did!" said th[] Hatt[]r.

"I d[]ny it!" said th[] March Har[].

"H[] d[]ni[]s it," said th[] King: "l[]av[] out that part."

"W[]ll, at any rat[], th[] Dormous[] said -- " th[] Hatt[]r w[]nt on, looking anxiously round to s[][] if h[] would d[]ny it too: but th[] Dormous[] d[]ni[]d nothing, b[]ing fast asl[][]p.

"Aft[]r that," continu[]d th[] Hatt[]r, "I cut som[] mor[] br[]ad-and-butt[]r -- "

"But what did th[] Dormous[] say?" on[] of th[] jury ask[]d.

"That I can't r[]m[]mb[]r," said th[] Hatt[]r.

"You must r[]m[]mb[]r," r[]mark[]d th[] King, "or I'll hav[] you []x[]cut[]d."

Th[] mis[]rabl[] Hatt[]r dropp[]d his t[]acup and br[]ad-and-butt[]r, and w[]nt down on on[] kn[][]. "I'm a poor man, your Maj[]sty," h[] b[]gan.

"You'r[] a v[]ry poor sp[]ak[]r," said th[] King.

H[]r[] on[] of th[] guin[]a-pigs ch[][]r[]d, and was imm[]diat[]ly suppr[]ss[]d by th[] offic[]rs of th[] court. (As that is rath[]r a hard word, I will just []xplain to you how it was don[]. Th[]y had a larg[] canvas bag, which ti[]d up at th[] mouth with strings: into this th[]y slipp[]d th[] guin[]a-pig, h[]ad first, and th[]n sat upon it.)

"I'm glad I'v[] s[][]n that don[]," thought Alic[]. "I'v[] so oft[]n r[]ad in th[] n[]wspap[]rs, at th[] []nd of trials, "Th[]r[] was som[] att[]mpts at applaus[], which was imm[]diat[]ly suppr[]ss[]d by th[] offic[]rs of th[] court," and I n[]v[]r und[]rstood what it m[]ant till now."

"If that's all you know about it, you may stand down," continu[]d th[] King.

"I can't go no low[]r," said th[] Hatt[]r: "I'm on th[] floor, as it is."

"Th[]n you may sit down," th[] King r[]pli[]d.

H[]r[] th[] oth[]r guin[]a-pig ch[][]r[]d, and was suppr[]ss[]d.

"Com[], that finish[]d th[] guin[]a-pigs!" thought Alic[]. "Now w[] shall g[]t on b[]tt[]r."

"I'd rath[]r finish my t[]a," said th[] Hatt[]r, with an anxious look at th[] Qu[][]n, who was r[]ading th[] list of sing[]rs.

"You may go," said th[] King, and th[] Hatt[]r hurri[]dly l[]ft th[] court, without []v[]n waiting to put his sho[]s on.

" -- and just tak[] his h[]ad off outsid[]," th[] Qu[][]n add[]d to on[] of th[] offic[]rs: but th[] Hatt[]r was out of sight b[]for[] th[] offic[]r could g[]t to th[] door.

"Call th[] n[]xt witn[]ss!" said th[] King.

Th[] n[]xt witn[]ss was th[] Duch[]ss's cook. Sh[] carri[]d th[] p[]pp[]r-box in h[]r hand, and Alic[] gu[]ss[]d who it was, []v[]n b[]for[] sh[] got into th[] court, by th[] way th[] p[]opl[] n[]ar th[] door b[]gan sn[][]zing all at onc[].

"Giv[] your []vid[]nc[]," said th[] King.

"Shan't," said th[] cook.

Th[] King look[]d anxiously at th[] Whit[] Rabbit, who said in a low voic[], "Your Maj[]sty must cross-[]xamin[] this witn[]ss."

"W[]ll, if I must, I must," th[] King said, with a m[]lancholy air, and, aft[]r folding his arms and frowning at th[] cook till his []y[]s w[]r[] n[]arly out of sight, h[] said in a d[][]p voic[], "What ar[] tarts mad[] of?"

"P[]pp[]r, mostly," said th[] cook.

"Tr[]acl[]," said a sl[][]py voic[] b[]hind h[]r.

"Collar that Dormous[]," th[] Qu[][]n shri[]k[]d out. "B[]h[]ad that Dormous[]! Turn that Dormous[] out of court! Suppr[]ss him! Pinch him! Off with his whisk[]rs!"

For som[] minut[]s th[] whol[] court was in confusion, g[]tting th[] Dormous[] turn[]d out, and, by th[] tim[] th[]y had s[]ttl[]d down again, th[] cook had disapp[]ar[]d.

"N[]v[]r mind!" said th[] King, with an air of gr[]at r[]li[]f. "Call th[] n[]xt witn[]ss." And h[] add[]d in an und[]rton[] to th[] Qu[][]n, "R[]ally, my d[]ar, you must cross-[]xamin[] th[] n[]xt witn[]ss. It quit[] mak[]s my for[]h[]ad ach[]!"

Alic[] watch[]d th[] Whit[] Rabbit as h[] fumbl[]d ov[]r th[] list, f[][]ling v[]ry curious to s[][] what th[] n[]xt witn[]ss would b[] lik[], " -- for th[]y hav[]n't got much []vid[]nc[] y[]t," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf. Imagin[] h[]r surpris[], wh[]n th[] Whit[] Rabbit r[]ad out, at th[] top of his shrill littl[] voic[], th[] nam[] "Alic[]!"

CHAPTER XII.
Alic[]'s Evid[]nc[]
"H[]r[]!" cri[]d Alic[], quit[] forg[]tting in th[] flurry of th[] mom[]nt how larg[] sh[] had grown in th[] last f[]w minut[]s, and sh[] jump[]d up in such a hurry that sh[] tipp[]d ov[]r th[] jury-box with th[] []dg[] of h[]r skirt, ups[]tting all th[] jurym[]n on to th[] h[]ads of th[] crowd b[]low, and th[]r[] th[]y lay sprawling about, r[]minding h[]r v[]ry much of a glob[] of goldfish sh[] had accid[]ntally ups[]t th[] w[][]k b[]for[].

"Oh, I b[]g your pardon!" sh[] []xclaim[]d in a ton[] of gr[]at dismay, and b[]gan picking th[]m up again as quickly as sh[] could, for th[] accid[]nt of th[] goldfish k[]pt running in h[]r h[]ad, and sh[] had a vagu[] sort of id[]a that th[]y must b[] coll[]ct[]d at onc[] and put back into th[] jury-box, or th[]y would di[].

"Th[] trial cannot proc[][]d," said th[] King in a v[]ry grav[] voic[], "until all th[] jurym[]n ar[] back in th[]ir prop[]r plac[]s -- all," h[] r[]p[]at[]d with gr[]at []mphasis, looking hard at Alic[] as h[] said so.

Alic[] look[]d at th[] jury-box, and saw that, in h[]r hast[], sh[] had put th[] Lizard in h[]ad downwards, and th[] poor littl[] thing was waving its tail about in a m[]lancholy way, b[]ing quit[] unabl[] to mov[]. Sh[] soon got it out again, and put it right; "not that it signifi[]s much," sh[] said to h[]rs[]lf; "I should think it would b[] quit[] as much us[] in th[] trial on[] way up as th[] oth[]r."

As soon as th[] jury had a littl[] r[]cov[]r[]d from th[] shock of b[]ing ups[]t, and th[]ir slat[]s and p[]ncils had b[][]n found and hand[]d back to th[]m, th[]y s[]t to work v[]ry dilig[]ntly to writ[] out a history of th[] accid[]nt, all []xc[]pt th[] Lizard, who s[][]m[]d too much ov[]rcom[] to do anything but sit with its mouth op[]n, gazing up into th[] roof of th[] court.

"What do you know about this busin[]ss?" th[] King said to Alic[].

"Nothing," said Alic[].

"Nothing what[]v[]r?" p[]rsist[]d th[] King.

"Nothing what[]v[]r," said Alic[].

"That's v[]ry important," th[] King said, turning to th[] jury. Th[]y w[]r[] just b[]ginning to writ[] this down on th[]ir slat[]s, wh[]n th[] Whit[] Rabbit int[]rrupt[]d: "Unimportant, your Maj[]sty m[]ans, of cours[]," h[] said in a v[]ry r[]sp[]ctful ton[], but frowning and making fac[]s at him as h[] spok[].

"Unimportant, of cours[], I m[]ant," th[] King hastily said, and w[]nt on to hims[]lf in an und[]rton[],

"important -- unimportant -- unimportant -- important -- " as if h[] w[]r[] trying which word sound[]d b[]st.

Som[] of th[] jury wrot[] it down "important," and som[] "unimportant." Alic[] could s[][] this, as sh[] was n[]ar []nough to look ov[]r th[]ir slat[]s; "but it do[]sn't matt[]r a bit," sh[] thought to h[]rs[]lf.

At this mom[]nt th[] King, who had b[][]n for som[] tim[] busily writing in his not[]-book, cackl[]d out "Sil[]nc[]!" and r[]ad out from his book, "Rul[] Forty-two. All p[]rsons mor[] than a mil[] high to l[]av[] th[] court."

Ev[]rybody look[]d at Alic[].

"I'm not a mil[] high," said Alic[].

"You ar[]," said th[] King.

"N[]arly two mil[]s high," add[]d th[] Qu[][]n.

"W[]ll, I shan't go, at any rat[]," said Alic[]: "b[]sid[]s, that's not a r[]gular rul[]: you inv[]nt[]d it just now."

"It's th[] old[]st rul[] in th[] book," said th[] King.

"Th[]n it ought to b[] Numb[]r On[]," said Alic[].

Th[] King turn[]d pal[], and shut his not[]-book hastily. "Consid[]r your v[]rdict," h[] said to th[] jury, in a low, tr[]mbling voic[].

"Th[]r[]'s mor[] []vid[]nc[] to com[] y[]t, pl[]as[] your Maj[]sty," said th[] Whit[] Rabbit, jumping up in a gr[]at hurry; "this pap[]r has just b[][]n pick[]d up."

"What's in it?" said th[] Qu[][]n.

"I hav[]n't op[]n[]d it y[]t," said th[] Whit[] Rabbit, "but it s[][]ms to b[] a l[]tt[]r, writt[]n by th[] prison[]r to -- to som[]body."

"It must hav[] b[][]n that," said th[] King, "unl[]ss it was writt[]n to nobody, which isn't usual, you know."

"Who is it dir[]ct[]d to?" said on[] of th[] jurym[]n.

"It isn't dir[]ct[]d at all," said th[] Whit[] Rabbit; "in fact, th[]r[]'s nothing writt[]n on th[] outsid[]." H[] unfold[]d th[] pap[]r as h[] spok[], and add[]d "It isn't a l[]tt[]r, aft[]r all: it's a s[]t of v[]rs[]s."

"Ar[] th[]y in th[] prison[]r's handwriting?" ask[]d anoth[]r of th[] jurym[]n.

"No, th[]y'r[] not," said th[] Whit[] Rabbit, "and that's th[] qu[][]r[]st thing about it." (Th[] jury all look[]d puzzl[]d.)

"H[] must hav[] imitat[]d som[]body []ls[]'s hand," said th[] King. (Th[] jury all bright[]n[]d up again.)

"Pl[]as[] your Maj[]sty," said th[] Knav[], "I didn't writ[] it, and th[]y can't prov[] I did: th[]r[]'s no nam[] sign[]d at th[] []nd."

"If you didn't sign it," said th[] King, "that only mak[]s th[] matt[]r wors[]. You must hav[] m[]ant som[] mischi[]f, or []ls[] you'd hav[] sign[]d your nam[] lik[] an hon[]st man."

Th[]r[] was a g[]n[]ral clapping of hands at this: it was th[] first r[]ally cl[]v[]r thing th[] King had said that day.

"That prov[]s his guilt," said th[] Qu[][]n.

"It prov[]s nothing of th[] sort!" said Alic[]. "Why, you don't []v[]n know what th[]y'r[] about!"

"R[]ad th[]m," said th[] King.

Th[] Whit[] Rabbit put on his sp[]ctacl[]s. "Wh[]r[] shall I b[]gin, pl[]as[] your Maj[]sty?" h[] ask[]d.

"B[]gin at th[] b[]ginning," th[] King said grav[]ly, "and go on till you com[] to th[] []nd: th[]n stop."

Th[]s[] w[]r[] th[] v[]rs[]s th[] Whit[] Rabbit r[]ad: -- 

"Th[]y told m[] you had b[][]n to h[]r,
    And m[]ntion[]d m[] to him:
Sh[] gav[] m[] a good charact[]r,
    But said I could not swim.

H[] s[]nt th[]m word I had not gon[]
    (W[] know it to b[] tru[]):
If sh[] should push th[] matt[]r on,
    What would b[]com[] of you?

I gav[] h[]r on[], th[]y gav[] him two,
    You gav[] us thr[][] or mor[];
Th[]y all r[]turn[]d from him to you,
    Though th[]y w[]r[] min[] b[]for[].

If I or sh[] should chanc[] to b[]
    Involv[]d in this affair,
H[] trusts to you to s[]t th[]m fr[][],
    Exactly as w[] w[]r[].

My notion was that you had b[][]n
    (B[]for[] sh[] had this fit)
An obstacl[] that cam[] b[]tw[][]n
    Him, and ours[]lv[]s, and it.

Don't l[]t him know sh[] lik[]d th[]m b[]st,
    For this must []v[]r b[]
A s[]cr[]t, k[]pt from all th[] r[]st,
    B[]tw[][]n yours[]lf and m[]."

"That's th[] most important pi[]c[] of []vid[]nc[] w[]'v[] h[]ard y[]t," said th[] King, rubbing his hands; "so now l[]t th[] jury -- "

"If any on[] of th[]m can []xplain it," said Alic[], (sh[] had grown so larg[] in th[] last f[]w minut[]s that sh[] wasn't a bit afraid of int[]rrupting him,) "I'll giv[] him sixp[]nc[]. I don't b[]li[]v[] th[]r[]'s an atom of m[]aning in it."

Th[] jury all wrot[] down on th[]ir slat[]s, "Sh[] do[]sn't b[]li[]v[] th[]r[]'s an atom of m[]aning in it," but non[] of th[]m att[]mpt[]d to []xplain th[] pap[]r.

"If th[]r[]'s no m[]aning in it," said th[] King, "that sav[]s a world of troubl[], you know, as w[] n[][]dn't try to find any. And y[]t I don't know," h[] w[]nt on, spr[]ading out th[] v[]rs[]s on his kn[][], and looking at th[]m with on[] []y[]; "I s[][]m to s[][] som[] m[]aning in th[]m, aft[]r all. " -- said I could not swim -- " you can't swim, can you?" h[] add[]d, turning to th[] Knav[].

Th[] Knav[] shook his h[]ad sadly. "Do I look lik[] it?" h[] said. (Which h[] c[]rtainly did not, b[]ing mad[] []ntir[]ly of cardboard.)

"All right, so far," said th[] King, and h[] w[]nt on mutt[]ring ov[]r th[] v[]rs[]s to hims[]lf: "'W[] know it to b[] tru[] -- ' that's th[] jury, of cours[] -- 'I gav[] h[]r on[], th[]y gav[] him two -- ' why, that must b[] what h[] did with th[] tarts, you know -- "

"But, it go[]s on 'th[]y all r[]turn[]d from him to you,'" said Alic[].

"Why, th[]r[] th[]y ar[]!" said th[] King triumphantly, pointing to th[] tarts on th[] tabl[]. "Nothing can b[] cl[]ar[]r than that. Th[]n again -- 'b[]for[] sh[] had this fit -- ' you n[]v[]r had fits, my d[]ar, I think?" h[] said to th[] Qu[][]n.

"N[]v[]r!" said th[] Qu[][]n furiously, throwing an inkstand at th[] Lizard as sh[] spok[]. (Th[] unfortunat[] littl[] Bill had l[]ft off writing on his slat[] with on[] fing[]r, as h[] found it mad[] no mark; but h[] now hastily b[]gan again, using th[] ink, that was trickling down his fac[], as long as it last[]d.)

"Th[]n th[] words don't fit you," said th[] King, looking round th[] court with a smil[]. Th[]r[] was a d[]ad sil[]nc[].

"It's a pun!" th[] King add[]d in an off[]nd[]d ton[], and []v[]rybody laugh[]d, "L[]t th[] jury consid[]r th[]ir v[]rdict," th[] King said, for about th[] tw[]nti[]th tim[] that day.

"No, no!" said th[] Qu[][]n. "S[]nt[]nc[] first -- v[]rdict aft[]rwards."

"Stuff and nons[]ns[]!" said Alic[] loudly. "Th[] id[]a of having th[] s[]nt[]nc[] first!"

"Hold your tongu[]!" said th[] Qu[][]n, turning purpl[].

"I won't!" said Alic[].

"Off with h[]r h[]ad!" th[] Qu[][]n shout[]d at th[] top of h[]r voic[]. Nobody mov[]d.

"Who car[]s for you?" said Alic[], (sh[] had grown to h[]r full siz[] by this tim[].) "You'r[] nothing but a pack of cards!"

At this th[] whol[] pack ros[] up into th[] air, and cam[] flying down upon h[]r: sh[] gav[] a littl[] scr[]am, half of fright and half of ang[]r, and tri[]d to b[]at th[]m off, and found h[]rs[]lf lying on th[] bank, with h[]r h[]ad in th[] lap of h[]r sist[]r, who was g[]ntly brushing away som[] d[]ad l[]av[]s that had flutt[]r[]d down from th[] tr[][]s upon h[]r fac[].

"Wak[] up, Alic[] d[]ar!" said h[]r sist[]r; "Why, what a long sl[][]p you'v[] had!"

"Oh, I'v[] had such a curious dr[]am!" said Alic[], and sh[] told h[]r sist[]r, as w[]ll as sh[] could r[]m[]mb[]r th[]m, all th[]s[] strang[] Adv[]ntur[]s of h[]rs that you hav[] just b[][]n r[]ading about; and wh[]n sh[] had finish[]d, h[]r sist[]r kiss[]d h[]r, and said, "It was a curious dr[]am, d[]ar, c[]rtainly: but now run in to your t[]a; it's g[]tting lat[]." So Alic[] got up and ran off, thinking whil[] sh[] ran, as w[]ll sh[] might, what a wond[]rful dr[]am it had b[][]n.

But h[]r sist[]r sat still just as sh[] l[]ft h[]r, l[]aning h[]r h[]ad on h[]r hand, watching th[] s[]tting sun, and thinking of littl[] Alic[] and all h[]r wond[]rful Adv[]ntur[]s, till sh[] too b[]gan dr[]aming aft[]r a fashion, and this was h[]r dr[]am: -- 

First, sh[] dr[]am[]d of littl[] Alic[] h[]rs[]lf, and onc[] again th[] tiny hands w[]r[] clasp[]d upon h[]r kn[][], and th[] bright []ag[]r []y[]s w[]r[] looking up into h[]rs -- sh[] could h[]ar th[] v[]ry ton[]s of h[]r voic[], and s[][] that qu[][]r littl[] toss of h[]r h[]ad to k[][]p back th[] wand[]ring hair that would always g[]t into h[]r []y[]s -- and still as sh[] list[]n[]d, or s[][]m[]d to list[]n, th[] whol[] plac[] around h[]r b[]cam[] aliv[] with th[] strang[] cr[]atur[]s of h[]r littl[] sist[]r's dr[]am.

Th[] long grass rustl[]d at h[]r f[][]t as th[] Whit[] Rabbit hurri[]d by -- th[] fright[]n[]d Mous[] splash[]d his way through th[] n[]ighbouring pool -- sh[] could h[]ar th[] rattl[] of th[] t[]acups as th[] March Har[] and his fri[]nds shar[]d th[]ir n[]v[]r-[]nding m[]al, and th[] shrill voic[] of th[] Qu[][]n ord[]ring off h[]r unfortunat[] gu[]sts to []x[]cution -- onc[] mor[] th[] pig-baby was sn[][]zing on th[] Duch[]ss's kn[][], whil[] plat[]s and dish[]s crash[]d around it -- onc[] mor[] th[] shri[]k of th[] Gryphon, th[] squ[]aking of th[] Lizard's slat[]-p[]ncil, and th[] choking of th[] suppr[]ss[]d guin[]a-pigs, fill[]d th[] air, mix[]d up with th[] distant sobs of th[] mis[]rabl[] Mock Turtl[].

So sh[] sat on, with clos[]d []y[]s, and half b[]li[]v[]d h[]rs[]lf in Wond[]rland, though sh[] kn[]w sh[] had but to op[]n th[]m again, and all would chang[] to dull r[]ality -- th[] grass would b[] only rustling in th[] wind, and th[] pool rippling to th[] waving of th[] r[][]ds -- th[] rattling t[]acups would chang[] to tinkling sh[][]p-b[]lls, and th[] Qu[][]n's shrill cri[]s to th[] voic[] of th[] sh[]ph[]rd boy -- and th[] sn[][]z[] of th[] baby, th[] shri[]k of th[] Gryphon, and all th[] oth[]r qu[][]r nois[]s, would chang[] (sh[] kn[]w) to th[] confus[]d clamour of th[] busy farm-yard -- whil[] th[] lowing of th[] cattl[] in th[] distanc[] would tak[] th[] plac[] of th[] Mock Turtl[]'s h[]avy sobs.

Lastly, sh[] pictur[]d to h[]rs[]lf how this sam[] littl[] sist[]r of h[]rs would, in th[] aft[]r-tim[], b[] h[]rs[]lf a grown woman; and how sh[] would k[][]p, through all h[]r rip[]r y[]ars, th[] simpl[] and loving h[]art of h[]r childhood: and how sh[] would gath[]r about h[]r oth[]r littl[] childr[]n, and mak[] th[]ir []y[]s bright and []ag[]r with many a strang[] tal[], p[]rhaps []v[]n with th[] dr[]am of Wond[]rland of long ago: and how sh[] would f[][]l with all th[]ir simpl[] sorrows, and find a pl[]asur[] in all th[]ir simpl[] joys, r[]m[]mb[]ring h[]r own child-lif[], and th[] happy summ[]r days.

THE END
